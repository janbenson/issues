No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules. After disposition of such amendments, the Chair shall put the question on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.</p>

If the amendment in the nature of a substitute is adopted, the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment. No further amendment shall be in order except the amendments printed in part C of the report of the Committee on Rules. At the conclusion of consideration of the amendments printed in part C of the report of the Committee on Rules, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill, to the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules, or to amendment number 1 printed in part C of the report of the Committee on Rules. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions.</p>
