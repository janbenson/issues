                                  Expressing the sense of Congress that John Arthur ‘‘Jack’’ Johnson should
                                      receive a posthumous pardon for the racially motivated conviction in
                                      1913 that diminished the athletic, cultural, and historic significance
                                      of Jack Johnson and unduly tarnished his reputation.

                                  Expressing the sense of Congress that John Arthur ‘‘Jack’’
                                     Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon for the
                                     racially motivated conviction in 1913 that diminished
                                     the athletic, cultural, and historic significance of Jack
                                     Johnson and unduly tarnished his reputation.

                                  Whereas John Arthur ‘‘Jack’’ Johnson was a flamboyant, de-
                                     fiant, and controversial figure in the history of the
                                     United States who challenged racial biases;
                                  Whereas Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in
                                     1878 to parents who were former slaves;





                                  Whereas Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and trav-
                                     eled throughout the United States, fighting White and
                                     African-American heavyweights;


                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas after being denied (on purely racial grounds) the op-
                                     portunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack
                                     Johnson was granted an opportunity by an Australian
                                     promoter to fight the reigning White title-holder, Tommy
                                     Burns;
                                  Whereas Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the
                                     first African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight
                                     Champion of the World;
                                  Whereas the victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns
                                     prompted a search for a White boxer who could beat
                                     Jack Johnson, a recruitment effort that was dubbed the
                                     search for the ‘‘great white hope’’;
                                  Whereas in 1910, a White former champion named Jim
                                     Jeffries left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno,
                                     Nevada;
                                  Whereas Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was
                                     deemed the ‘‘Battle of the Century’’;
                                  Whereas the defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to
                                     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the
                                     racially motivated murder of African-Americans nation-
                                     wide;
                                  Whereas the relationships of Jack Johnson with White
                                     women compounded the resentment felt toward him by
                                     many Whites;
                                  Whereas between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans
                                     were lynched, some for simply for being ‘‘too familiar’’
                                     with White women;
                                  Whereas in 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910





                                     (commonly known as the ‘‘White Slave Traffic Act’’ or
                                     the ‘‘Mann Act’’) (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which out-

                                  Whereas in October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved
                                     with a White woman whose mother disapproved of their
                                     relationship and sought action from the Department of
                                     Justice, claiming that Jack Johnson had abducted her
                                     daughter;
                                  Whereas Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on
                                     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across
                                     State lines for an ‘‘immoral purpose’’ in violation of the
                                     Mann Act;
                                  Whereas the Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were
                                     dropped when the woman refused to cooperate with Fed-
                                     eral authorities, and then married Jack Johnson;
                                  Whereas Federal authorities persisted and summoned a
                                     White woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that
                                     Jack Johnson had transported her across State lines for
                                     the purpose of ‘‘prostitution and debauchery’’;
                                  Whereas in 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating
                                     the Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Fed-
