                                                     Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act.

                                  Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound re-





                                     cording industries that are the envy of the world, due to

                                          the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these
                                          industries for many decades;
                                  Whereas for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected re-
                                     peated calls by the recording industry to impose a per-
                                     formance fee on local radio stations for simply playing
                                     music on the radio and upsetting the mutually beneficial
                                     relationship between local radio and the recording indus-
                                     try;
                                  Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and pro-
                                     motion to the recording industry and performers of music
                                     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers,
                                     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and
                                     publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets,
                                     ring tones, music videos and associated merchandise;
                                  Whereas Congress found that ‘‘the sale of many sound re-
                                     cordings and the careers of many performers benefited
                                     considerably from airplay and other promotional activities
                                     provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-sup-
                                     ported, free over-the-air broadcasting’’;
                                  Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands of
                                     hours of essential local news and weather information
                                     during times of national emergencies and natural disas-
                                     ters, as well as public affairs programming, sports, and
                                     hundreds of millions of dollars of time for public service
                                     announcements and local fund raising efforts for worthy
                                     charitable causes, all of which are jeopardized if local
                                     radio stations are forced to divert revenues to pay for a
                                     new performance fee;
                                  Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations





                                     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new per-

                                          nesses that play music including bars, restaurants, retail

                                          shopping centers and transportation facilities; and
                                  Whereas the hardship that would result from a new perform-
                                     ance fee would hurt American businesses, and ultimately
                                     the American consumers who rely on local radio for news,
                                     weather, and entertainment; and such a performance fee
                                     is not justified when the current system has produced the
                                     most prolific and innovative broadcasting, music, and
                                     sound recording industries in the world: Now, therefore,

                                    2 concurring), That Congress should not impose any new
                                    3 performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to
                                    4 the public performance of sound recordings on a local
