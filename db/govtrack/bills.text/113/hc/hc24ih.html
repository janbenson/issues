<p>Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth;</p><p>Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax;</p><p>Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States;</p><p>Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment;</p><p>Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers;</p><p>Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today&#8217;s global economy;</p><p>Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America&#8217;s global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and</p><p>Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on pro-growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it</p><ul><p><em>  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),</em> That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.</p></ul></body>
