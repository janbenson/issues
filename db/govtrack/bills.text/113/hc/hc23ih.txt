                                          CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the conditions
                                     for the United States becoming a signatory to the United
                                     Nations Arms Trade Treaty, or to any similar agreement
                                     on the arms trade.

                                  Whereas in October 2009, the United States voted in the
                                     United Nations General Assembly to participate in the
                                     negotiation of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty;
                                  Whereas in July 2012, the United Nations Conference on the
                                     Arms Trade Treaty convened to negotiate the text of the
                                     Arms Trade Treaty;
                                  Whereas in December 2012, the United Nations General As-
                                     sembly voted to hold a final negotiating conference on the
                                     Arms Trade Treaty in March 2013, on the basis of the
                                     text of July 2012;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty poses significant risks to the
                                     national security, foreign policy, and economic interests
                                     of the United States as well as to the constitutional
                                     rights of United States citizens and United States sov-
                                     ereignty;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty fails to expressly recognize
                                     the fundamental, individual right to keep and to bear
                                     arms and the individual right of personal self-defense, as
                                     well as the legitimacy of hunting, sports shooting, and





                                     other lawful activities pertaining to the private ownership

                                          of firearms and related materials, and thus risks infring-
                                          ing on freedoms protected by the Second Amendment;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty places free democracies and
                                     totalitarian regimes on a basis of equality, recognizing
                                     their equal right to transfer arms, and is thereby dan-
                                     gerous to the security of the United States;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty’s criteria for assessing the
                                     potential consequences of arms transfers are vague, easily
                                     politicized, and readily manipulated;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty’s model for using these cri-
                                     teria is incompatible with the decisionmaking model for
                                     arms transfers employed by the United States under
                                     Presidential Decision Directive 34, which dates from
                                     1995;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty will create opportunities to
                                     engage in ‘‘lawfare’’ against the United States via the
                                     misuse of the treaty’s criteria in foreign tribunals and
                                     international fora;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty could hinder the United
                                     States from fulfilling its strategic, legal, and moral com-
                                     mitments to provide arms to allies such as the Republic
                                     of China (Taiwan) and the State of Israel;
                                  Whereas the creation of an international secretariat to ad-
                                     minister and assist in the implementation of the Arms
                                     Trade Treaty risks the delegation of authority to a bu-
                                     reaucracy that is not accountable to the people of the
                                     United States;
                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty urges the provision of ca-

                                     plement the Arms Trade Treaty, which could create a

                                  Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty risks imposing costly regu-
                                     latory burdens on United States businesses, for example,
                                     by creating onerous reporting requirements that could
                                     damage the domestic defense manufacturing base and re-

                                  Whereas an Arms Trade Treaty that has not been signed by
                                     the President and received the advice and consent of the
                                     Senate should not bind the United States in any respect
                                     as customary international law, jus cogens, or any other
                                     principle of international law that bypasses the treaty
