                                          Expressing the sense of Congress that a day should be designated as

                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                              FEBRUARY 15, 2013
                                  Ms. FUDGE (for herself, Ms. CHU, and Mr. GRIJALVA) submitted the following
                                      concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight

                                          CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of Congress that a day should be des-
                                     ignated as ‘‘National Voting Rights Act Mobilization
                                     Day’’.

                                  Whereas the affirmation of the Declaration of Independence
                                     that ‘‘all men are created equal’’ too often has been dis-
                                     regarded throughout our Nation’s history;
                                  Whereas voting is the fundamental political right because it
                                     is ‘‘preservative of all rights’’;
                                  Whereas the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the
                                     Constitution prohibit racial discrimination in voting by
                                     the States;





                                  Whereas when Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of
                                     1965, certain States employed tests and devices that were



                                                                                             2
                                          race-neutral on their face but were used to prevent racial
                                          minorities from registering and voting;
                                  Whereas when Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of
                                     1965, certain States and their political subdivisions had
                                     resorted to substituting new discriminatory practices for
                                     ones that were enjoined by the Federal courts, requiring
                                     aggrieved plaintiffs to assume the burden of repeated liti-
                                     gation to vindicate their fourteenth and fifteenth amend-
                                     ment rights;
                                  Whereas Congress enacted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act
                                     of 1965 to require certain States and political subdivi-
                                     sions to submit new or modified voting practices for Fed-
                                     eral review before they can be used;
                                  Whereas Congress reauthorized section 5 of the Voting
                                     Rights Act of 1965 in 1970, 1975, and 1982 after find-
                                     ing a continuing pattern of racial discrimination in voting
                                     by the covered jurisdictions;
                                  Whereas the Supreme Court repeatedly has upheld section 5
                                     against constitutional challenges, and pointed to section
                                     5 as a model for the appropriate exercise of Congress’ en-
                                     forcement authority under the Reconstruction Amend-
                                     ments;
                                  Whereas section 5 has proven to be one of the most effective
                                     provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in blocking
                                     and deterring many thousands of discriminatory voting
                                     practices that would have denied or abridged the ability
                                     of minority citizens to register, vote, and elect candidates
                                     of their choice;





                                  Whereas Congress in 2006 reauthorized section 5 by over-
                                     whelming margins based upon an extensive record of con-

                                          tinued racial voting discrimination within the covered ju-
                                          risdictions;
                                  Whereas section 5 continues to require Federal review for
                                     changes in all or part of 16 States with histories of offi-
                                     cial discrimination, where the legislative record showed
                                     that the bulk of racial voting discrimination has remained
                                     concentrated;
                                  Whereas States and political subdivisions that show a clean
                                     recent record of voting rights compliance can ‘‘bail out’’
                                     from section 5 coverage;
                                  Whereas there are ongoing election problems in both the cov-
                                     ered and the non-covered States which urgently require
                                     the attention of Congress, including voting delays, badly
                                     designed and executed voter purges, unduly restrictive
                                     voter identification laws, and deceptive and intimidating
                                     phone calls, flyers, and billboards, but these problems do
                                     not necessarily require the non-covered States to comply
                                     with the section 5 preclearance remedy;
                                  Whereas section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 remains
                                     necessary to protect the hard-won gains in minority elec-
                                     toral participation in the covered States since 1965
                                     against the imposition of new racially discriminatory vot-
                                     ing practices;
                                  Whereas the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral argu-
                                     ments in a constitutional challenge to the 2006 reauthor-
                                     ization of section 5; and
                                  Whereas February 27 would be an appropriate day for the

                                     tance of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in ensuring

                                    2 concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a day
                                    3 should be designated as ‘‘National Voting Rights Act Mo-
                                    4 bilization Day’’, to remind all Americans of the critical
                                    5 role that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 continues to play
                                    6 in protecting the right to vote, and for them to voice their
                                    7 support for this landmark civil rights law.
