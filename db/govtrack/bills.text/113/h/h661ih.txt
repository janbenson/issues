                                    8                        (1) The Tiahrt Amendments severely limit the

                                    3                        (2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collec-
                                    4              tion of valuable information, and the establishment
                                    5              of effective policies to prevent illegal guns.
                                    6                        (3) Having effective policies to prevent illegal
                                    7              gun trafficking makes our families and communities
                                    8              safer.

                                  10               ment of the gun laws by requiring most background
                                  11               check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and
                                  12               by barring the government from requiring annual in-
                                  13               ventory audits by owners of gun shops
                                  14                         (5) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would
                                  15               support law enforcement efforts and give the public
                                  16               vital information needed to craft the most effective
                                  17               policies against illegal guns.
