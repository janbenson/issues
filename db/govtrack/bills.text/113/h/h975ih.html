<p>To amend title 10, United States Code, to extend the duration of the Physical Disability Board of Review and to expand the authority of such Board to review the separation of members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a mental condition not amounting to disability, including separation on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Servicemember Mental Health Review Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><ul><p>(1) Since September 11, 2001, approximately 30,000 veterans have been separated from the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality disorder or adjustment disorder.</p><p>(2) Nearly all veterans who are separated on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder are prohibited from accessing service-connected disability compensation, disability severance pay, and disability retirement pay.</p><p>(3) Many veterans who are separated on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder are unable to find employment because of the &#8216;personality disorder&#8217; or &#8216;adjustment disorder&#8217; label on their Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.</p><p>(4) The Government Accountability Office has found that the regulatory compliance of the Department of Defense in separating members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder was as low as 40 percent between 2001 and 2007.</p><p>(5) Expansion of the authority of the Physical Disability Board of Review to include review of the separation of members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a mental condition not amounting to disability, including separation on the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder, is warranted in order to ensure that any veteran wrongly separated on such basis will have the ability to access disability benefits and employment opportunities available to veterans.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
