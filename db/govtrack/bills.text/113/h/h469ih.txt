                                              ozone pollution from Federal facilities.
                                    1              Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Heat Island and Smog

                                    7              The Congress finds the following:
                                    8                        (1) Parking lots, dark-colored rooftops, and




                                    9              lack of tree canopy in urban areas causes the ‘‘heat

                                                                                             2
                                    1              hotter than surrounding rural areas due to solar
                                    2              heat being collected by components of the built envi-
                                    3              ronment.
                                    4                        (2) According to the EPA, this heat island ef-
                                    5              fect can raise afternoon-to-evening temperatures of
                                    6              urban areas by up to 22 degrees Fahrenheit com-
                                    7              pared to surrounding rural areas.
                                    8                        (3) Higher air temperatures in urban areas lead
                                    9              to higher levels of ground level ozone pollution, com-
                                  10               monly known as smog.
                                  11                         (4) In hot weather, each additional degree Cel-
                                  12               sius in heat causes approximately a 5-percent in-
                                  13               crease in smog pollution, according to Lawrence
                                  14               Berkley National Laboratory studies.
                                  15                         (5) Negative health impacts of smog include in-
                                  16               creased incidence of asthma, throat irritation, scar-

                                  19                         (6) The urban heat island effect increases elec-

                                  22               tree canopy can reduce air-conditioning costs by up
                                  23               to 50 percent, creating potential cost savings




                                  24               through lower Federal energy bills.

                                    1                        (7) According to the Lawrence Berkley Na-

                                    7                        (8) Urban heat island temperatures can be low-
                                    8              ered by increasing tree canopy and by using paving
