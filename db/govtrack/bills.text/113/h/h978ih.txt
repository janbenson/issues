                                    3                        (1) Congress has not given serious consider-
                                    4              ation to conscription since establishing the current
                                    5              Selective Service System in 1979.
                                    6                        (2) The Department of Defense has neither

                                  11               would allow approximately 175 Reserve officers to
                                  12               return to more important duties.
                                  13                         (4) The estimated savings of $24.2 million an-
                                  14               nually from the amendments made by this Act would
                                  15               be better used to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
