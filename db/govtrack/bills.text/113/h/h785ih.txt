                                                                            A BILL

                                                        for other purposes.

                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Halt Index Trading
                                    5 of Energy Commodities (HITEC) Act’’.
                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              The Congress finds the following:





                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Investment in our commodities markets has
                                    2              grown dramatically in recent years. While the vol-
                                    3              ume of futures contracts traded in the United States
                                    4              was only 630,000,000 in 1998, that volume
                                    5              ballooned to over 3,200,000,000 in 2007.
                                    6                        (2) According to testimony provided to the
                                    7              Committee on Natural Resources of the House of
                                    8              Representatives, this growth in volume has been ac-
                                    9              companied by a huge increase in the percentage of
                                  10               commodity futures contracts owned by speculators.
                                  11               While physical hedgers used to account for 70 per-
                                  12               cent of futures contracts and speculators accounted
                                  13               for just 30 percent, those numbers have reversed,
                                  14               and speculators now possess 70 percent of all open
                                  15               commodity futures contracts.
                                  16                         (3) Almost all of this increase in speculation
                                  17               has been caused by a surge in trading of commodity
                                  18               index funds.
                                  19                         (4) Commodity index trading is investing in
                                  20               funds or other financial products which are indexed
                                  21               to changes in value of various commodities traded on
                                  22               commodity markets in the United States. These
                                  23               funds can be tied to a basket of different commod-
                                  24               ities or just to a single commodity.

                                    1                        (5) Investment in funds tied to these indexes
                                    2              has grown enormously in the last 2 decades. Accord-

                                    6              $160,000,000,000 in February 2012, and net long
                                    7              positions in West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil
                                    8              reached to over $39,000,000,000. Many of the inves-
                                    9              tors in these funds are institutional clients, such as
                                  10               pension funds and universities.
                                  11                         (6) The vast majority of investors in commodity
                                  12               index funds do not use the commodities involved.
                                  13               These investors are only interested in profiting from
                                  14               a rise in value of the commodities and must sell
                                  15               their interests in the commodities before the futures
                                  16               contracts they own close. This practice, known as
                                  17               rolling, causes hundreds of billions of dollars of addi-
                                  18               tional trading to flow through our commodities mar-
                                  19               kets each month, artificially increasing the volatility
                                  20               of our markets and driving up prices for many of
                                  21               our commodities, including crude oil.
                                  22                         (7) Because our commodities markets are tied
                                  23               to the actual retail prices of our commodities, the
                                  24               artificial and excessive levels of speculation have sig-




                                  25               nificantly increased the retail prices our citizens pay

                                                                                             4
                                    1              for their commodities. In the case of oil, excessive
                                    2              speculation may have added nearly $1.00 to the per
                                    3              gallon price of gasoline.
                                    4                        (8) As sharp increases in energy costs reduce
                                    5              economic growth, these commodity index funds are
                                    6              creating a weight on the overall economy, threat-
                                    7              ening to delay our Nation’s full recovery from the
                                    8              2008 financial crisis and recession.
                                    9                        (9) Thus, commodity index funds hurt economic
                                  10               growth and consumer’s wallets.
                                  11                         (10) In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
                                  12               Act, Congress ordered the Commodity Futures
                                  13               Trading Commission to limit the number of posi-
                                  14               tions that a person or a class of persons may hold
                                  15               in the commodities markets. Congress has taken ini-
                                  16               tial steps to set boundaries on commodity trading,
                                  17               but more must be done to address the role of com-
                                  18               modity index funds in the energy commodity mar-
                                  19               kets.
                                  20                         (11) Because oil prices have been at elevated
                                  21               levels for much of the last year, Congress believes
                                  22               the situation is an emergency and warrants imme-
