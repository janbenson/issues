Such agency shall designate the rule for sunset review unless such agency determines that it would not be in the public interest to conduct a sunset review of the rule. In making such determination, such agency shall take into account the number and nature of other petitions received on the same rule and whether or not such petitions have been denied.</p><p>(2) FORM AND CONTENT OF PETITION- A petition under paragraph (1)--</p><ul><p>(A) shall be in writing, but is not otherwise required to be in any particular form; and</p><p>(B) shall identify the rule for which sunset review is requested with reasonable specificity and state on its face that the petitioner seeks sunset review of the rule.</p></ul><p>(3) RESPONSE REQUIRED FOR NONCOMPLYING PETITIONS- If an agency determines that a petition does not meet the requirements of this subsection, the agency shall provide a response to the petitioner within 30 days after receiving the petition, notifying the petitioner of the problem and providing information on how to formulate a petition that meets those requirements.</p><p>(4) DECISION WITHIN 90 DAYS- Within the 90-day period beginning on the date of receiving a petition that meets the requirements of this subsection, the agency shall transmit a response to the petitioner stating whether the petition was granted or denied, except that the agency may extend such period by a total of not more than 30 days.</p><p>(5) PETITIONS DEEMED GRANTED FOR SUBSTANTIAL INEXCUSABLE DELAY- A petition for sunset review of a rule is deemed to have been granted by an agency, and such agency is deemed to have designated the rule for sunset review, if a court finds there is a substantial and inexcusable delay, beyond the period specified in paragraph (4), in notifying the petitioner of the agency&#8217;s determination to grant or deny the petition.</p><p>(6) PUBLIC LOG- Each agency shall maintain a public log of petitions submitted under this subsection, that includes the status or disposition of each petition.</p></ul><p>(d) Congressional Requests-</p><ul><p>(1) IN GENERAL- An appropriate committee of the Congress, or a majority of the majority party members or a majority of nonmajority party members of such committee, may request in writing that the Administrator designate any rule that is not a significant rule for sunset review.

CRITERIA FOR SUNSET REVIEW.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Compliance With Other Laws- In order for any rule subject to sunset review to continue without change or to be modified or consolidated in accordance with this Act, such rule must be authorized by law and meet all applicable requirements that would apply if it were issued as a new rule pursuant to section 553 of title 5, United States Code, or other statutory rulemaking procedures required for that rule.
