Based on such review, if the Chief Actuary is unable to determine that, with regard to such single chronic disease, the application of such clause did not increase costs to the Federal government under the Medicare program under this title over such period, then the Secretary shall review the findings of the Chief Actuary and determine whether such clause shall continue to be applied with regard to such single chronic disease. In conducting such review and making such determination, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which the application of such clause with regard to such single chronic disease effects the health outcomes of part D eligible individuals and any savings and costs to the Federal government under the Medicare program under this title.&#8217;.</p></ul></ul></ul></blockquote></ul></ul></body>
