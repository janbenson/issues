                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                               JANUARY 23, 2013

                                      York) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee

                                                                            A BILL
                                         To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow
                                          all eligible voters to vote by mail in Federal elections.
                                    1              Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
                                    2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Universal Right to
                                    5 Vote by Mail Act of 2013’’.
                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              Congress finds the following:
                                    8                        (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the




                                    9              United States because voters in some States have
                                                                                             2
                                    1              the universal right to vote by mail while voters in
                                    2              other States do not.
                                    3                        (2) Many voters often have work, family, or
                                    4              other commitments that make getting to polls on the
                                    5              date of an election difficult or impossible. Under
                                    6              current State laws, many of these voters are not per-
                                    7              mitted to vote by mail.
                                    8                        (3) 29 States and the District of Columbia cur-
                                    9              rently allow universal absentee voting (also known as
                                  10               ‘‘no-excuse’’ absentee voting), which permits any
                                  11               voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a
                                  12               reason for the request, and no State which has im-
                                  13               plemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched
                                  14               back.
                                  15                         (4) Voting by mail gives voters more time to
                                  16               consider their choices, which is especially important
                                  17               as many ballots contain greater numbers of ques-
                                  18               tions about complex issues than in the past due to
                                  19               the expanded use of the initiative and referendum
                                  20               process in many States.
                                  21                         (5) Allowing all voters the option to vote by
                                  22               mail can lead to increased voter participation.
                                  23                         (6) Allowing all voters the option to vote by
                                  24               mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who




                                  25               choose to vote at the polls.

                                                                                             3
                                    1                        (7) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters
                                    2              as an alternative to going to the polls. Voting by
                                    3              mail has become increasingly popular with voters
                                    4              who want to be certain that they are able to vote no
                                    5              matter what comes up on Election Day.
                                    6                        (8) No evidence exists suggesting the potential
                                    7              for fraud in absentee balloting is greater than the
                                    8              potential for fraud by any other method of voting.
                                    9                        (9) Many of the reasons which voters in many
                                  10               States are required to provide in order to vote by
                                  11               mail require the revelation of personal information
                                  12               about health, travel plans, or religious activities,
                                  13               which violate voters’ privacy while doing nothing to
                                  14               prevent voter fraud.
                                  15                         (10) State laws which require voters to obtain
                                  16               a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and
                                  17               inconvenience to voters without increasing security.
