                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Justice for the Amer-
                                    5 ican Diplomats Held Hostage in Tehran Act’’.


                                    1     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.                                  2
                                    2              Congress finds the following:
                                    3                        (1) In 1979, agents of the Islamic Republic of
                                    4              Iran stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran,
                                    5              taking American military and diplomatic personnel
                                    6              hostage.
                                    7                        (2) The Iranian Government then held United
                                    8              States Embassy personnel as hostages for 444 days,
                                    9              subjecting them to profound physical and mental
                                  10               abuse, and forcing the United States to negotiate
                                  11               their release, under duress.
                                  12                         (3) In the resultant agreement (commonly
                                  13               known as the Algiers Accords) the United States
                                  14               agreed, among other steps, to bar and preclude the
                                  15               hostages from prosecuting any claim against Iran in
                                  16               United States courts.
                                  17                         (4) The Algiers Accords were never submitted
                                  18               to Congress for ratification and none of the hostages
                                  19               or their family members was consulted by the
                                  20               United States Government or consented to these
                                  21               provisions precluding prosecution of their claims.
                                  22                         (5) Notwithstanding the applicability of legal
                                  23               principles which allowed the United States to re-
                                  24               nounce this obligation to bar and preclude the pros-




                                  25               ecution of claims in United States courts because
                                  26               they were so clearly negotiated under duress, the

                                                                                             3
                                    1              United States Government has repeatedly intervened
                                    2              in United States courts to preclude the prosecution
                                    3              of any claim by the hostages against Iran, arguing
                                    4              that, in its opinion, compliance with this agreement
                                    5              served overriding national security interests which
                                    6              justified the taking of the hostages’ right to pursue
                                    7              compensation from Iran in United States courts.
                                    8                        (6) The United States Government has failed to
                                    9              propose any process by which the hostages and their
                                  10               family members could be compensated for the inju-
                                  11               ries and damages suffered by them by reason of the
                                  12               horrific and heinous treatment while in captivity.
                                  13                         (7) Congress has determined that the provision
                                  14               of compensation to the hostages and their families
                                  15               through, among other sources, funds obtained by
                                  16               vesting and liquidating property in which Iran and
                                  17               its surrogates claim an interest (including any funds
                                  18               held by the United States, including in trust) is fully
                                  19               consistent with the Algiers Accords.
                                  20                         (8) Congress has determined that, only upon
                                  21               the payment of such compensation, should the agree-

                                    1              withstanding the duress under which the United
