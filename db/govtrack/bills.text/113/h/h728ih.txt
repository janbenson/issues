                                  12               half of all pregnancies, in the United States are un-
                                  13               intended, and nearly half of unintended pregnancies
                                  14               end in abortion.
                                  15                         (4) Women rely on prescription contraceptives
                                  16               for a range of medical purposes in addition to birth

                                    5                        (7) Emergency contraception is approved to
                                    6              prevent pregnancy. It will not work if a woman is al-

                                    8                        (8) Access to legal contraception is a protected
                                    9              fundamental right in the United States and should
