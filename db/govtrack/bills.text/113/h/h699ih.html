<ul><p>(a) The House finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) every bipartisan commission has recommended--and the majority of Americans agree--that we should take a balanced, bipartisan approach to reducing the deficit that addresses both revenue and spending; and</p><p>(2) sequestration is a meat-ax approach to deficit reduction that imposes deep and mindless cuts, regardless of their impact on vital services and investments.</p></ul><p>(b) It is the sense of the House that the Congress should replace the entire 10-year sequester established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 with a balanced approach that would increase revenues without increasing the tax burden on middle-income Americans, and decrease long-term spending while maintaining the Medicare guarantee, protecting Social Security and a strong social safety net, and making strategic investments in education, science, research, and critical infrastructure necessary to compete in the global economy.</p></ul></body>
