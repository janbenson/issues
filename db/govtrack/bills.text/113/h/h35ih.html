<p>Mr. STOCKMAN (for himself and Mr. BROUN of Georgia) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary</p><hr/><p/><center><p>A BILL</p></center>
<p>To restore safety to America&#8217;s schools.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Safe Schools Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Findings- Congress finds--</p><ul><p>(1) that the Supreme Court has found language nearly identical to the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; to be unconstitutional;</p><p>(2) that the enactment of the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; has been met with an almost uninterrupted series of horrific and tragic shootings at Columbine, Newtown and in other American schools;</p><p>(3) that the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; has been a deadly failure. According to research by GeorgiaCarry.org, in the 22 years prior to enactment of the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; there were two school shootings in which four or more people were intentionally murdered in a short period of time, and in the 22 years after the enactment of the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; there have been 10 such school shootings;</p><p>(4) that American schools had not been plagued with this succession of horrific shootings prior to the enactment of the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217;;</p><p>(5) that horrific massacres on school campuses in Pearl, Mississippi, and southwestern Virginia, were averted by armed staff and students;</p><p>(6) that none of the murderers in any of these horrific school shootings were deterred by the fact that, in addition to murder, gun possession was also illegal in those locations; and</p><p>(7) that the reason that the &#8216;Gun Free School Zones Act&#8217; has made American schools unsafe is that shooters now know that they can victimize American school campuses with no fear that victims will be armed.</p></ul><p>(b) Purpose- It is the purpose of this Act to restore safety to America&#8217;s schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to defend the children and themselves.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. SAFE SCHOOLS.</h3>
<ul><p>Subsection (q) of section 922 of Title 18, United States Code, is repealed.</p></ul></body>
