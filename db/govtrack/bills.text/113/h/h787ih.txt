                                    7              Congress finds the following:
                                    8                        (1) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)
                                    9              was created by Congress in 1975, to protect the Na-
                                  10               tion from any future oil supply disruptions. When
                                  11               the program was established, United States refiners
                                  12               were capable of handling light crude and medium
                                  13               crude and the makeup of the SPR matched this ca-
                                  14               pacity. This is not the case today.
                                  15                         (2) A GAO analysis found that nearly half of
                                  16               the refineries considered vulnerable to supply disrup-
                                  17               tions are not compatible with the types of oil cur-
                                  18               rently stored in the SPR and would be unable to
                                  19               maintain normal refining capacity if forced to rely
                                  20               on SPR oil as currently constituted, thereby reduc-
                                  21               ing the effectiveness of the SPR in the event of a
                                  22               supply disruption. GAO concluded that the SPR
                                  23               should be comprised of at least 10 percent heavy
                                  24               crude.
