                                    4     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

                                    5              (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:
                                    6                        (1) Participation in sports teaches youth critical
                                    7              life skills and has a significant positive impact on all
                                    8              areas of their lives, especially for girls.
                                    9                        (2) Girls who participate in sports have higher
                                  10               levels of confidence and self-esteem, lower levels of
                                  11               depression, are less likely to be suicidal, are more
                                  12               likely to have a positive body image than female
                                  13               non-athletes, and are half as likely to experience an
                                  14               unintended pregnancy as compared to female non-
                                  15               athletes. Girls who participate in sports have higher
                                  16               graduation rates, receive better grades, and are less
                                  17               likely to smoke or use illegal drugs.
                                  18                         (3) Sports participation effectively combats obe-
                                  19               sity, which is particularly significant given that one
                                  20               in six girls are obese or overweight and African-
                                  21               Americans and Hispanic girls face even greater
                                  22               risks.
                                  23                         (4) Despite advances in athletic opportunities
                                  24               for women and girls since the passage of title IX of




                                  25               the Education Amendments of 1972, discrimination
                                  26               still limits athletic opportunities for females in inter-

                                                                                             3
                                    1              scholastic and intercollegiate athletics. Girls com-
                                    2              prise 49 percent of the high school population, but
                                    3              receive only 41 percent of all interscholastic athletic
                                    4              participation opportunities nationwide. This trans-
                                    5              lates into 1,300,000 fewer opportunities to play high
                                    6              school sports for girls than for boys. These lost par-
                                    7              ticipation opportunities also result in the loss of ath-
                                    8              letic scholarships that make it possible for many
                                    9              girls and young women to attend college.
                                  10                         (5) There is ample evidence that girls’ teams
                                  11               often receive inferior benefits and services when they
                                  12               do play, in areas such as overall budgets; travel;
                                  13               equipment; uniforms; facilities, including locker
                                  14               rooms, fields, and practice and competitive facilities;
                                  15               training and medical services; publicity; access to
                                  16               coaches; and scheduling of practices, games, and
                                  17               sports seasons.
                                  18                         (6) Without information about how athletic op-
                                  19               portunities and benefits are being allocated at the el-

                                  21               be deprived of opportunities to play sports and to re-
                                  22               ceive athletic scholarships to attend college.
                                  23                         (7) Students, parents, and schools should be




                                  24               aware of the athletic opportunities and benefits

                                    5                        (1) To ensure that information about the allo-

                                    9                        (2) To promote equal opportunities for both

                                  12                         (3) To provide boys and girls with equal access
