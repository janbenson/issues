                                    1                        (1) In 1988, 93 percent of the North Cascades
                                    2              National Park Complex was designated the Stephen
                                    3              Mather Wilderness.
                                    4                        (2) A road corridor was deliberately excluded
                                    5              from the wilderness designation to provide for the
                                    6              continued use and maintenance of the upper
                                    7              Stehekin Valley Road.

                                    9              access to Stephen Mather Wilderness trailheads and
                                  10               North Cascades National Park from the Lake Che-

                                  12                         (4) Record flooding in 1995 and again in 2003
                                  13               caused severe damage to the upper Stehekin Valley
                                  14               Road and led to the closure of a 9.9-mile section of
                                  15               the road between Car Wash Falls and Cottonwood

                                  18               not have the flexibility to rebuild the upper Stehekin
                                  19               Valley Road away from the Stehekin River due to
                                  20               the current location of the non-wilderness road cor-
                                  21               ridor provided by Congress in 1988.
                                  22                         (6) It is a high priority that the people of the
                                  23               United States, including families, the disabled, and
                                  24               the elderly, have reasonable access to the National

                                    5              cades National Park Complex is an important part
                                    6              of the economy for rural communities in the area.
                                    7                        (9) Additional management flexibility would
                                    8              allow the National Park Service to consider reten-
                                    9              tion of the upper Stehekin Valley Road in a manner
                                  10               that provides for no net loss of wilderness.
