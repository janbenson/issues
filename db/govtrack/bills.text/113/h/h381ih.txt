                                    4                        (2) Recognizing the importance of education

                                  19               George W. Bush stated that ‘‘we must address the

                                    3                        (6) As stated in a recent report from the Na-

                                    6              America does best—investing in the creativity and
                                    7              imagination of our people. To win the future, we
                                    8              must out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the
