 4   SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 5        Congress finds the following:
 6             (1) Hurricane Sandy inflicted catastrophic
 7        damage in the Northeastern United States.
 8             (2) Houses of worship across the Northeast’s
 9        many faiths and denominations were among the pri-
10        vate nonprofit facilities that sustained damage.
11             (3) Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples,
12        and other houses of worship throughout communities
13        in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and else-
14        where play an essential role in the daily lives of the
15        communities.
16             (4) The Federal Emergency Management Agen-
17        cy’s (FEMA) public assistance program provides fi-
18        nancial grants for the repair of various types of pri-
19        vate nonprofit facilities.
20             (5) Among the types of nonprofits to which
21        FEMA provides such grants are those in which citi-
22        zens gather and engage in a variety of educational,
23        enrichment, and social activities. These activities are
24        essential to community building and occur in houses
25        of worship.

 1            (6) Under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Re-
 2       lief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121
 3       et seq.), FEMA’s disaster relief program is a general
 4       government program under which assistance is pro-
 5       vided in the wake of a natural disaster using criteria
 6       that are neutral with regard to religion.
 7            (7) Congress has previously enacted legislation
 8       providing financial assistance to religious nonprofit
 9       institutions, including houses of worship, on terms
10       equal to other eligible nonprofit institutions.
11            (8) Such legislation is consistent with recent
12       precedents of the Supreme Court of the United
13       States and legal opinions issued by the Office of
14       Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice.
