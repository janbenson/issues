<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) the availability of minerals and metals is essential for economic growth, national security, technological innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply chain;</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) the exploration, production, processing, use, and recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic well-being, security, and general welfare of the Nation;</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) the industrialization of China and India has driven demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of resource nationalism exemplified by China&#x2019;s reduction and stoppage of exports of rare-earth mineral elements necessary for telecommunications, military technologies, medical devices, agricultural production, and renewable energy technologies;</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) the United States has vast mineral resources but is becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources;</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) 25 years ago the United States was dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral materials, 6 of which were entirely imported to meet the Nation&#x2019;s requirements and another 16 of which were imported to meet more than 60 percent of the Nation&#x2019;s needs;</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) by 2010, United States import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials more than doubled from 30 to 67 commodities, 18 commodities were imported entirely to meet the Nation&#x2019;s requirements, and another 25 commodities required imports of more than 50 percent;</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) the United States lacks a coherent national policy to assure the availability of minerals essential to manufacturing, national economic well-being and security, agricultural production, and global economic competitiveness; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(8) the Nation&#x2019;s ability to compete and innovate requires proper planning and preparation today to meet tomorrow&#x2019;s mineral needs.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:25">SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:26">(a) In General- It is the continuing policy of the United States to promote an adequate and stable supply of minerals to maintain our Nation&#x2019;s economic well-being, security, and manufacturing, industrial, energy, agricultural, and technological capabilities.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(b) Policy Goals- Implementation of the policy set forth in subsection (a) requires that the Federal Government coordinate the Federal departments and agencies responsible for ensuring that supply, to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:28">(1) facilitate the availability, development, and production of domestic mineral resources to meet national needs, including the demands of the Nation&#x2019;s manufacturing and agricultural industries;</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">(2) promote and encourage the development of economically and environmentally sound, safe, and stable domestic mining, minerals, metals, processing, and minerals recycling industries;</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">(3) establish an assessment capability for identifying the mineral demands, supply, and needs of our Nation; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">(4) minimize duplication, needless paperwork, and delays in the administration of Federal and State laws and regulations, and issuance of permits and authorizations necessary to explore, develop, and produce minerals and construct and operate mineral-related facilities.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:32">SEC. 4.
