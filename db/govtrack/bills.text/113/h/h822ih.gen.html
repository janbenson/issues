</blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3 nid="t0:ih:18">&#x2018;SEC. 271. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:19">&#x2018;Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:20">&#x2018;(1) The economic stature and competitiveness of the United States requires increasingly sophisticated levels of geographic knowledge and mastery of geographic tools.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">&#x2018;(2) It is estimated that the United States geospatial industry generated $73,000,000,000 in revenue last year, with half a million high-wage jobs, and that the industry is growing at between 25-30 percent per year. This burgeoning industry will not be able to maximize its growth potential without a sustained Federal investment in geography education.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">&#x2018;(3) A 2012 report by a Council on Foreign Relations task force, United States Education Reform and National Security, states that the lack of global awareness among American citizens increasingly jeopardizes their ability to interact with local and global peers or participate meaningfully in business, diplomatic, and military situations.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">&#x2018;(4) Geographic literacy is essential to a well prepared citizenry in the 21st century because geographic factors assume greater importance as the world&#x2019;s economies, societies, and political structures grow more global in scale.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">&#x2018;(5) The 2010 National Assessment of Educational Progress in geography shows that fewer than 30 percent of students tested in grades four, eight, and twelve scored at grade-level or above. These scores have stayed the same or gotten worse since the last time the test was administered in 2001.</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">&#x2018;(6) The National Academy of Sciences urged creation of a national program to improve the geographic competence of the United States general population and the school age population.</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">&#x2018;(7) Geography is one of the &#x2018;core academic subjects&#x2019; defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">&#x2018;(8) A recent National Geographic Society survey found that all 50 States and the District of Columbia recognize geography in their curricula or content standards, and an increasing number require geography for graduation and include geography in mandated statewide assessments.</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">&#x2018;(9) Seven of ten educators responding to a National Geographic survey felt their professional development opportunities in geography were inadequate and half believed their schools had inadequate basic materials for teaching geography.</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">&#x2018;(10) The National Geographic Society has spent more than 25 years pioneering an extraordinarily effective national program for improving the teaching of geography by engaging university faculty, geographers, and highly trained teachers in State Geographic Alliances dedicated to providing high-quality professional development opportunities for kindergarten through grade 12 teachers.</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">&#x2018;(11) More than 80 colleges and universities in all 50 States have received grants from the National Geographic Society to support State Geographic Alliances and their professional development programs. Alliance-trained kindergarten through grade 12 teachers and their higher education partners conduct workshops, develop localized teaching materials, and facilitate communication among thousands of teachers whose responsibilities include teaching of geography in various formats and grade levels.</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">&#x2018;(12) A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning that assessed student academic achievement in geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers out-performed other students by almost 10 percent.</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">&#x2018;(13) We live in a changing world with multiple and evolving threats to national security, including terrorism, asymmetrical warfare, and social unrest. As the nature of the threat evolves, so do the tools, knowledge, and skills needed to respond. A 2013 National Academies report states that it is likely that qualified Geography Information Systems and remote sensing experts are already hard to find. Long before 2030, competition and a small number of graduates will likely result in shortages in all emerging areas and in the core areas of cartography, photogammetry, and geodesy.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3 nid="t0:ih:33">&#x2018;SEC. 272.
