<ul><p nid="t0:ih:42">The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:43">(1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job preservation and retirement security are placed at greater risk.</p><p nid="t0:ih:44">(2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent and are escaping adequate scrutiny.</p><p nid="t0:ih:45">(3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses and industries.</p></ul></ul><p/><h4 nid="t0:ih:46"><center><p nid="t0:ih:47">TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES</p></center></h4>
