                                    4              (a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the

                                    6              (b) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:
                                    7                        (1) The 2010 National Survey by the Centers

                                    9              4 women have been the victim of severe physical vio-
                                  10               lence by an intimate partner, while 1 in 7 men expe-

                                    2              ner. Female victims of intimate partner violence ex-
                                    3              perienced different patterns of violence than male
                                    4              victims. Female victims experienced multiple forms
                                    5              of these types of violence; male victims most often
                                    6              experienced physical violence.
                                    7                        (2) A critical issue in domestic violence cases is
                                    8              the risk of continued victimization during the pre-
                                    9              trial period. Offenders may violate no-contact orders,
                                  10               further injure victims, or intimidate them. Such oc-
                                  11               currences highlight a critical need for efficiency in
                                  12               court proceedings.
                                  13                         (3) Of 3,750 intimate partner violence cases

                                  17               who were present, 60 percent directly witnessed the

                                  24               and other intimate partners often entail complex

                                    1              criminal justice system. In the 1990s, many jurisdic-
                                    2              tions began to create specialized domestic violence
                                    3              courts for judges to ensure follow-through on cases,
                                    4              aid domestic violence victims, and hold offenders ac-

                                    6              service agencies. By specializing in domestic violence
                                    7              offenses, these courts aim to process cases more effi-
                                    8              ciently and deliver more consistent rulings about do-
                                    9              mestic violence statutes. Some domestic violence
                                  10               courts also incorporate a stronger focus on rehabili-
                                  11               tation of offenders and deterrence of repeat offenses.
                                  12               These courts can also be more sensitive to the needs
                                  13               of victims and be able to direct victims to additional
                                  14               community resources.
                                  15                         (5) One-third of violent felony defendants in

                                    6                        (7) There are more than 400,000 children in
                                    7              foster care in the United States. Congress has
                                    8              charged juvenile courts with oversight of child wel-
                                    9              fare cases. Highly trained and engaged judges fo-
