                                    8              Congress finds the following:





                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech
                                    2              on December 10, 2009, President Obama said, ‘‘I
                                    3              know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks
                                    4              the satisfying purity of indignation. But I also know
                                    5              that sanctions without outreach—and condemnation
                                    6              without discussion—can carry forward a crippling
                                    7              status quo. No repressive regime can move down a
                                    8              new path unless it has the choice of an open door.’’.
                                    9                        (2) President Obama stated on November 14,
                                  10               2012, that, ‘‘With respect to Iran, I very much want
                                  11               to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. I was
                                  12               very clear before the campaign, I was clear during
                                  13               the campaign and I’m now clear after the cam-
                                  14               paign—we’re not going to let Iran get a nuclear
                                  15               weapon. But I think there is still a window of time
                                  16               for us to resolve this diplomatically. We’ve imposed
                                  17               the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an im-
                                  18               pact on Iran’s economy. There should be a way in
                                  19               which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while
                                  20               still meeting their international obligations and pro-
                                  21               viding clear assurances to the international commu-
                                  22               nity that they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapon.’’.
