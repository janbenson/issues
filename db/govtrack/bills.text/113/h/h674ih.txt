                                    1                        (1) The island of Rota was the only major is-
                                    2              land in the Mariana Islands to be spared the de-

                                    1                        (5) In addition to prehistoric sites, the island of
                                    2              Rota boasts historic sites remaining from the Japa-
                                    3              nese period (1914–1945). Several of these sites are

                                    7                        (6) The island of Rota’s natural resources are
                                    8              significant because of the extent and intact condition
                                    9              of its native limestone forest that provides habitat
                                  10               for several federally endangered listed species, the
                                  11               Mariana crow, and the Rota bridled white-eye birds,
                                  12               that are also native to the island of Rota. Three en-
                                  13               dangered plant species are also found on Rota and
                                  14               two are endemic to the island.
                                  15                         (7) Because of the significant cultural and nat-
                                  16               ural resources listed above, on September 2005, the

                                  18               pleted a preliminary resource assessment on the is-
                                  19               land of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
