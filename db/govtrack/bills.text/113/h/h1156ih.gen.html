FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:14">Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:15">(1) In 1988, 93 percent of the North Cascades National Park Complex was designated the Stephen Mather Wilderness.</p><p nid="t0:ih:16">(2) A road corridor was deliberately excluded from the wilderness designation to provide for the continued use and maintenance of the upper Stehekin Valley Road.</p><p nid="t0:ih:17">(3) The upper Stehekin Valley Road provides access to Stephen Mather Wilderness trailheads and North Cascades National Park from the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(4) Record flooding in 1995 and again in 2003 caused severe damage to the upper Stehekin Valley Road and led to the closure of a 9.9-mile section of the road between Car Wash Falls and Cottonwood Camp.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(5) The National Park Service currently does not have the flexibility to rebuild the upper Stehekin Valley Road away from the Stehekin River due to the current location of the non-wilderness road corridor provided by Congress in 1988.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(6) It is a high priority that the people of the United States, including families, the disabled, and the elderly, have reasonable access to the National Parks system and their public lands.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(7) The 1995 Lake Chelan National Recreation Area General Management Plan calls for retaining vehicle access to Cottonwood Camp.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(8) Tourism associated with the North Cascades National Park Complex is an important part of the economy for rural communities in the area.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(9) Additional management flexibility would allow the National Park Service to consider retention of the upper Stehekin Valley Road in a manner that provides for no net loss of wilderness.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:24">SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:25">The Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988 (<public-law-reference session="100" number="668">Public Law 100-668</public-law-reference>) is amended by inserting after section 206 the following:</p></ul><p/><blockquote><h3 nid="t0:ih:26">&#x2018;SEC. 207.
