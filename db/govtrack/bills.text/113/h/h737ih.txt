                                    2              (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—
                                    3                        (1) the United States has a history of cata-
                                    4              strophic natural disasters, including hurricanes, tor-
                                    5              nadoes, flood, fire, earthquakes, and volcanic erup-
                                    6              tions;
                                    7                        (2) although catastrophic natural disasters
                                    8              occur infrequently, they will continue to occur and
                                    9              are predictable;
                                  10                         (3) such disasters generate large economic
                                  11               losses and a major component of those losses comes
                                  12               from damage and destruction to homes;
                                  13                         (4) for the majority of Americans, their invest-

                                  15               asset and the protection of that investment is para-
                                  16               mount to economic and social stability;
                                  17                         (5) the United States needs to take and support
                                  18               State actions to be better prepared for and better
                                  19               protected from catastrophes;
                                  20                         (6) as the risk of catastrophic losses grows, so
                                  21               do the risks that any premiums collected by private




                                  22               insurers for extending coverage will be insufficient to
                                  23               cover future catastrophes, and private insurers, in

                                    6                        (7) such effects on the insurance industry have
                                    7              been harmful to economic activity in States exposed
                                    8              to major catastrophes and have placed significant
                                    9              burdens on residents of such States;
                                  10                         (8) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
                                  11               struck the United States in 2005, causing over

                                  13               sured          losses           to        homeowners                 in         excess   of
                                  14               $50,000,000,000;
                                  15                         (9) while the total costs of Hurricane Sandy
                                  16               have not yet been calculated, Fitch Ratings, a global
                                  17               credit ratings agency, has estimated that insured
                                  18               losses will amount to between $20,000,000,000 and
                                  19               $25,000,000,000;
