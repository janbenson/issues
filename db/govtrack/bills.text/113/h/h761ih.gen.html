<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) The industrialization of China and India has driven demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of resource nationalism exemplified by China&#x2019;s reduction in exports of rare-earth elements necessary for telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare technologies, and conventional and renewable energy technologies.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are essential for economic growth, national security, technological innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply chain.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic well-being, security and general welfare of the Nation.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:21">(A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation&#x2019;s requirements, and for another 16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 percent of the Nation&#x2019;s needs.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(B) By 2011 the United States import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials had more than doubled from 30 to 67 commodities, 19 of which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation&#x2019;s requirements, and for another 24 commodities, imported more than 50 percent of the Nation&#x2019;s needs.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(C) The United States share of worldwide mineral exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 percent in the early 1990s.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(D) In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding government take and social issues affecting mining.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:25">SEC. 3.
