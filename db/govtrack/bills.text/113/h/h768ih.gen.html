<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Effective teachers and principals are the backbone of our schools and the key to successful students.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Teachers and principals deserve our full support as they take on one of the most important and most challenging responsibilities--educating our children.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) High-quality evaluations that provide meaningful feedback are a crucial element to giving educators the support they need to successfully achieve at high levels.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) Teachers and principals also deserve access to professional development opportunities so they can continue to learn and grow as educators.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) Research shows that high-quality and effective teaching is the single most important school-based factor impacting student learning.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) In formal studies, including research highlighted in &#x2018;The Widget Effect&#x2019;, nearly 75 percent of teachers reported that they have not received specific suggestions on how to improve classroom practices in annual evaluations.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) Across all local educational agencies, only 43 percent of teachers, including novice teachers who may benefit the most from feedback, report that current evaluations systems are helpful.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(8) Research also shows that school leadership quality is second only to teacher quality among school-related factors in its impact on student learning.</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">(9) Strong school leadership is a key determinant of whether schools can attract and retain effective teachers particularly in high poverty schools, as research has found teachers&#x2019; satisfaction to be more influenced by the culture of the school than by the demographics of the school&#x2019;s students.</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(10) Principals set the direction and vision for a school, and studies find that strong instructional leadership and a focus on building a shared mission focused on student achievement can create a positive teaching and learning environment.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(11) Constructive feedback specifying areas for improvement could be useful to both teachers and principals who are dedicated to growing professionally.</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">(12) The most effective way to turn around a struggling school is through talented teachers and an inspirational principal.</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">(13) Effective teachers and principals also deserve to be recognized for excellence and to receive commendations in areas of strong performance and improvement.</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">(14) Evaluations should give teachers and principals the opportunity to foster mutually beneficial professional relationships.</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">(15) Teachers and principals should provide input and contribute directly to designing, implementing, and improving evaluation systems in their school districts.</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(16) High-quality teacher and principal evaluations have the potential to be a powerful tool and should play a significant role in building a talented force of educators.</p><p nid="t0:ih:33">(17) The goal of evaluation systems is to improve individual, as well as whole school and district, teaching and leadership practices to benefit students.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:34">SEC. 3.
