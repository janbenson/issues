                                    3                        (2) The unfilled positions are mainly in the

                                    7                        (3) In less than 20 years, an overall loss of ex-
                                    8              pertise and management skill is expected to result
                                    9              from the gradual departure from the workplace of
                                  10               77,200,000 workers.
                                  11                         (4) Postsecondary success and workforce readi-
                                  12               ness can be achieved through attainment of a recog-
