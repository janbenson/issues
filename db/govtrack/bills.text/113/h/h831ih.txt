                                      introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on
                                      Education and the Workforce




                                                                            A BILL

                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fair Wages for Work-

                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              Congress finds the following:



                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Current Federal law allows the Secretary of
                                    2              Labor to grant special wage certificates to entities
                                    3              that provide employment to workers with disabilities,
                                    4              allowing such entities to pay their disabled workers
                                    5              at rates that are lower than the Federal minimum
                                    6              wage.
                                    7                        (2) The practice of paying workers with disabil-
                                    8              ities less than the Federal minimum wage dates
                                    9              back to the 1930s, when there were virtually no em-
                                  10               ployment opportunities for disabled workers in the
                                  11               mainstream workforce.
                                  12                         (3) Today, advancements in vocational rehabili-
                                  13               tation, technology, and training provide disabled
                                  14               workers with greater opportunities than in the past,
                                  15               and the number of such workers in the national
                                  16               workforce has dramatically increased.
                                  17                         (4) Employees with disabilities, when provided
                                  18               the proper rehabilitation services, training, and
                                  19               tools, can be as productive as nondisabled employees.
                                  20               Even those individuals that are considered most se-
                                  21               verely disabled have been able to successfully obtain
                                  22               employment earning minimum wage or higher.
                                  23                         (5) While some employers possessing special




                                  24               wage certificates claim to provide rehabilitation and

                                    1              competitive employment, the fact that such employ-
                                    2              ers can pay their workers less than the Federal min-
                                    3              imum wage gives them an incentive to exploit the
                                    4              cheap labor provided by their disabled workers rath-
                                    5              er than to prepare those workers for integrated em-
                                    6              ployment in the mainstream economy.
                                    7                        (6) Many employers with a history of paying
                                    8              subminimum wages benefit from philanthropic dona-
                                    9              tions and preferred status when bidding on Federal
                                  10               contracts. Yet they claim that paying minimum wage
                                  11               to their employees with disabilities would result in
                                  12               lack of profitability and forced reduction of their
                                  13               workforces.
                                  14                         (7) Other employers, recognizing that the pay-
                                  15               ment of subminimum wages is in fact exploitation of
                                  16               disabled workers, are now paying the Federal min-
                                  17               imum wage, or higher, to their employees with dis-
                                  18               abilities without reducing their workforces, while still
                                  19               maintaining their profitability. For example, Na-
                                  20               tional Industries for the Blind (NIB) agencies ex-
                                  21               ploited their blind employees for years through the
                                  22               payment of subminimum wages, claiming they could
                                  23               not maintain profitability otherwise. Now, ‘‘All NIB
