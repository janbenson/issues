                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              Congress finds the following:

                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) The United States and Mexico share a bor-
                                    2              der of nearly 2,000 miles, a cultural heritage, and
                                    3              a desire to grow both economies through cooperation
                                    4              and hard work.
                                    5                        (2) Border commerce is vital to the United
                                    6              States economy. Mexico is the United States third-
                                    7              largest trading partner, behind only Canada and
                                    8              China. In 2010, trade between the United States
                                    9              and Mexico reached $367,000,000,000, amounting
                                  10               to more than $1,000,000,000 per day.
                                  11                         (3) Mexico is the second-largest export market
                                  12               for United States businesses and approximately 22
                                  13               States depend on Mexico as their number one or two
                                  14               trading partner.
                                  15                         (4) The growth of international trade has out-
                                  16               paced United States land ports of entry’s workload
                                  17               capacity, resulting in congestion and delays. This in-
                                  18               creased congestion hurts businesses that rely on safe
                                  19               and efficient cross-border traffic.
