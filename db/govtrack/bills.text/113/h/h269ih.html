<ul><p>(a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From Private Sources- The House of Representatives finds and declares that the current system of privately financed campaigns for election to the House of Representatives has the capacity, and is often perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United States by--</p><ul><p>(1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived conflicts of interest, by encouraging Members of the House to accept large campaign contributions from private interests that are directly affected by Federal legislation;</p><p>(2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Members&#8217; accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to be accountable to the major contributors who finance their election campaigns;</p><p>(3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and unfair influence within the political process;</p><p>(4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;</p><p>(5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to mount competitive House election campaigns;</p><p>(6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive elections, because large campaign contributors tend to donate their money to incumbent Members, thus causing House elections to be less competitive; and</p><p>(7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry out their public responsibilities.</p></ul><p>(b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From the Fair Elections Fund- The House of Representatives finds and declares that providing the option of the replacement of large private campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections to the House of Representatives would enhance American democracy by--</p><ul><p>(1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest created by fully private financing of the election campaigns of public officials and restoring public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative processes through a program which allows participating candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral campaigns;</p><p>(2) increasing the public&#8217;s confidence in the accountability of Members to the constituents who elect them, which derives from the program&#8217;s qualifying criteria to participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and participate in the program;</p><p>(3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign contributions as a determinant of a citizen&#8217;s influence within the political process by facilitating the expression of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging political participation, incentivizing participation on the part of Members through the matching of small dollar contributions;</p><p>(4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the influence of campaign contributions;</p><p>(5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run for the House of Representatives and encouraging more competitive elections;</p><p>(6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by citizens of every level of wealth; and</p><p>(7) freeing Members from the incessant preoccupation with raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their public responsibilities.</p></ul></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE I--FAIR ELECTIONS FINANCING OF HOUSE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS</p></center></h4>
