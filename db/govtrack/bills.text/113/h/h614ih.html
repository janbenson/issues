SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;American Discoveries and American Jobs Commission Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.</h3>
<ul><p>There is established a commission to be known as the &#8216;Commission on American Discoveries and American Jobs&#8217; (in this Act referred to as the &#8216;Commission&#8217;).</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) The Federal Government is estimated to have spent $147,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2010 on research and development (not including funds allocated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)) to meet the mission requirements of the Federal departments and agencies.</p><p>(2) Federal Government research and development has led to new products and processes for the commercial marketplace, including antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, microwaves, and bioengineered drugs.</p><p>(3) There are many other technologies and techniques generated in the Federal laboratory system that could have market value if further developed by the industrial community, and the knowledge base created by the research and development activities of such system can serve as a foundation for additional commercially relevant efforts in the private sector.</p><p>(4) Technological progress is responsible for up to half the growth of the United States economy and is the principal driving force behind long-term economic growth and increases in our standard of living.</p><p>(5) It is only through commercialization, a function of the business sector, that a significant stimulus to economic growth occurs. Thus, there is congressional interest in accelerating development and commercialization activities in the private sector through legislation.</p><p>(6) Royalties derived from intellectual property rights provide the academic community a way to support further research and the business sector a means to obtain a return on their financial contributions to such research.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 4.
