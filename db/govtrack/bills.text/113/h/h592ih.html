<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Hurricane Sandy inflicted catastrophic damage in the Northeastern United States.</p><p>(2) Houses of worship across the Northeast&#8217;s many faiths and denominations were among the private nonprofit facilities that sustained damage.</p><p>(3) Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other houses of worship throughout communities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and elsewhere play an essential role in the daily lives of the communities.</p><p>(4) The Federal Emergency Management Agency&#8217;s (FEMA) public assistance program provides financial grants for the repair of various types of private nonprofit facilities.</p><p>(5) Among the types of nonprofits to which FEMA provides such grants are those in which citizens gather and engage in a variety of educational, enrichment, and social activities. These activities are essential to community building and occur in houses of worship.</p><p>(6) Under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), FEMA&#8217;s disaster relief program is a general government program under which assistance is provided in the wake of a natural disaster using criteria that are neutral with regard to religion.</p><p>(7) Congress has previously enacted legislation providing financial assistance to religious nonprofit institutions, including houses of worship, on terms equal to other eligible nonprofit institutions.</p><p>(8) Such legislation is consistent with recent precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States and legal opinions issued by the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
