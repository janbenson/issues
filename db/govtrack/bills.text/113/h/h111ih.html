The unit was made up of the United States-Philippine Military Forces of the Commonwealth Army, Guerrilla Units, New Philippine Scout.</p><p>(3) The Filipino Infantry Regiment, was mostly composed of first-generation immigrants living along the Pacific Coast, who volunteered after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, later many second-generation Filipino-American soldiers joined the Regiment from Hawaii.</p><p>(4) The Philippine Scout units and the New Philippine Scouts were directly recruited by the United States Army for the war effort.</p><p>(5) Under extremely severe occupation policies imposed by the Japanese, it was the anti-Japanese resistance movement that drew more and more Filipinos to its side and through 1943 many of these anti-Japanese guerrillas recovered or newly established liaisons with the United States Army Command of the Southwest Pacific Area and placed themselves under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.</p><p>(6) These Filipino soldiers responded to President Roosevelt&#8217;s call-to-arms and later fought under the American flag during World War II.</p><p>(7) After the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Filipino and American troops literally shared the same fate at Bataan, Corregidor, and the &#8216;Death March&#8217;.</p><p>(8) Many made the ultimate sacrifice as both soldiers in the United States Armed Forces in the Far East and as guerilla fighters during the Imperial Japanese occupation of the Philippines.</p><p>(9) These troops had served under the expectation that they would be treated as United States military servicemembers.</p><p>(10) The Rescission Act of 1946 later passed, which stated that Filipino forces would not be deemed to have been active military.</p><p>(11) Congress recognizes the courage and bravery of the Filipino and Filipino American servicemen and servicewomen who have fought alongside and in the United States Armed Forces.</p><p>(12) The United States remains forever indebted to the bravery, valor, and dedication to country these men displayed.</p><p>(13) Their commitment and sacrifice demonstrates a highly uncommon and commendable sense of patriotism and honor.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
