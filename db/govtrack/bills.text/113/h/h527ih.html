Nothing in this subsection authorizes the Secretary to withhold information from Congress, prevents the Secretary from complying with a request for information from any other Federal department or agency requesting information for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, or prevents the Secretary from complying with an order of a court of the United States in an action brought by the United States or by the Secretary.</p></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(e) Helium Production Fund-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) IN GENERAL- All amounts received under this Act shall be credited to the Helium Production Fund, which shall be available without fiscal year limitation for purposes considered necessary by the Secretary to carry out this subsection.</p><p>&#8216;(2) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- Amounts in the Helium Production Fund may be used by the Secretary to conduct helium auctions and otherwise administer this Act.</p><p>&#8216;(3) REPAYMENT AMOUNTS- During the period described in subsection (a)(4), amounts in the Helium Production Fund in excess of amounts the Secretary considers necessary to conduct helium auctions and otherwise administer this Act shall be paid to the general fund of the Treasury and credited against all amounts required to be repaid to the United States under this Act as of October 1, 1995.</p><p>&#8216;(4) CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND MAINTENANCE- Amounts in the Helium Production Fund in excess of amounts the Secretary considers necessary to carry out paragraphs (1) through (3) may be used to fund the following capital investments in upgrades and maintenance at the Federal Helium reserve:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) Wellhead maintenance at the Cliffside Gas Field helium storage reservoir.</p><p>&#8216;(B) Capital investments in maintenance and upgrades of facilities that pressurize the Cliffside Gas Field helium storage reservoir.</p><p>&#8216;(C) Capital investments in maintenance and upgrades of equipment related to the storage, withdrawal, transportation, purification, and sale of crude helium at the Cliffside Gas Field helium storage reservoir.</p><p>&#8216;(D) Any other scheduled or unscheduled maintenance of the Cliffside Gas Field helium storage reservoir and helium pipeline.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(5) EXCESS FUNDS- Amounts in the Helium Production Fund in excess of amounts the Secretary considers necessary to carry out paragraphs (1) through (4) shall be paid to the general fund of the Treasury.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(f) Extraction of Helium From Deposits on Federal Land- All amounts received by the Secretary from the sale or disposition of crude helium on Federal land shall be paid to the general fund of the Treasury and credited against all amounts required to be repaid to the United States under this Act as of October 1, 1995.&#8217;.</p><p>(b) Report- Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report describing all expenditures by the Bureau of Land Management for operation and maintenance of the Federal Helium Reserve (as that term is defined in the amendment made by section 2(3)), investments made by the Bureau for such reserve, and scheduled or unscheduled maintenance of such reserve or its infrastructure to be conducted by the Bureau.</p></ul></blockquote><p/><h3>SEC. 4.
