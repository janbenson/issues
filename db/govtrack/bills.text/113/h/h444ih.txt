                                    4 fied budget if the President’s budget for fiscal year 2014

                                    8                        (1) With this year’s expected failure to meet the
                                    9              statutory deadline for submission of his budget, as
                                  10               stated by the Office of Management and Budget, the
                                  11               President will have only met the statutory deadline
                                  12               in one of his five budget submissions.
                                  13                         (2) Despite a promise to cut the deficit in half,
                                  14               the deficit doubled during the President’s first year
                                  15               in office and has exceeded $1 trillion for four years
                                  16               now.
                                  17                         (3) Since taking office, the President has al-
                                  18               lowed the Federal debt to grow by nearly $6 trillion
                                  19               and total debt now exceeds the size of the entire
                                  20               economy of the United States.
                                  21                         (4) Under the President’s most recent budget
                                  22               submission, the budget never achieves balance.

                                  24               submission includes the admission that under his
