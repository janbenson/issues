<p>To amend title 10, United States Code, to permit additional retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired pay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related Special Compensation and to eliminate the phase-in period under current law with respect to such concurrent receipt.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Retired Pay Restoration Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Findings- Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled military retirees were required to fund their own veterans&#8217; disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned retired pay for each dollar received in veterans&#8217; disability compensation.</p><p>(2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.</p><p>(3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and for combat-disabled retirees.</p><p>(4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent.</p><p>(5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new thresholds.</p><p>(6) Congress is not content with the status quo.</p></ul><p>(b) Sense of Congress- It is the sense of Congress that military retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United States should not be reduced because a military retiree is also eligible for veterans&#8217; disability compensation awarded for service-connected disability.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
