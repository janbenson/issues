<p>To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require the establishment of teacher evaluation programs.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Securing Teacher Effectiveness, Leadership, Learning, And Results Act of 2013&#8217; or the &#8216;STELLAR Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Effective teachers and principals are the backbone of our schools and the key to successful students.</p><p>(2) Teachers and principals deserve our full support as they take on one of the most important and most challenging responsibilities--educating our children.</p><p>(3) High-quality evaluations that provide meaningful feedback are a crucial element to giving educators the support they need to successfully achieve at high levels.</p><p>(4) Teachers and principals also deserve access to professional development opportunities so they can continue to learn and grow as educators.</p><p>(5) Research shows that high-quality and effective teaching is the single most important school-based factor impacting student learning.</p><p>(6) In formal studies, including research highlighted in &#8216;The Widget Effect&#8217;, nearly 75 percent of teachers reported that they have not received specific suggestions on how to improve classroom practices in annual evaluations.</p><p>(7) Across all local educational agencies, only 43 percent of teachers, including novice teachers who may benefit the most from feedback, report that current evaluations systems are helpful.</p><p>(8) Research also shows that school leadership quality is second only to teacher quality among school-related factors in its impact on student learning.</p><p>(9) Strong school leadership is a key determinant of whether schools can attract and retain effective teachers particularly in high poverty schools, as research has found teachers&#8217; satisfaction to be more influenced by the culture of the school than by the demographics of the school&#8217;s students.</p><p>(10) Principals set the direction and vision for a school, and studies find that strong instructional leadership and a focus on building a shared mission focused on student achievement can create a positive teaching and learning environment.</p><p>(11) Constructive feedback specifying areas for improvement could be useful to both teachers and principals who are dedicated to growing professionally.</p><p>(12) The most effective way to turn around a struggling school is through talented teachers and an inspirational principal.</p><p>(13) Effective teachers and principals also deserve to be recognized for excellence and to receive commendations in areas of strong performance and improvement.</p><p>(14) Evaluations should give teachers and principals the opportunity to foster mutually beneficial professional relationships.</p><p>(15) Teachers and principals should provide input and contribute directly to designing, implementing, and improving evaluation systems in their school districts.</p><p>(16) High-quality teacher and principal evaluations have the potential to be a powerful tool and should play a significant role in building a talented force of educators.</p><p>(17) The goal of evaluation systems is to improve individual, as well as whole school and district, teaching and leadership practices to benefit students.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
