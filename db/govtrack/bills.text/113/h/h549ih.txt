                                    3     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.
                                    4              The Congress makes the following findings:
                                    5                        (1) Rising costs resulting from natural disasters
                                    6              are placing an increasing strain on the ability of
                                    7              property and casualty insurance companies to assure
                                    8              payment of homeowners’ claims and other insurance
                                    9              claims arising from major natural disasters now and
                                  10               in the future.
                                  11                         (2) Present tax laws do not provide adequate
                                  12               incentives to assure that natural disaster insurance
                                  13               is provided or, where such insurance is provided,
                                  14               that funds are available for payment of insurance
                                  15               claims in the event of future catastrophic losses from
                                  16               major natural disasters, as present law requires an
                                  17               insurer wishing to accumulate surplus assets for this
                                  18               purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax retained
                                  19               earnings.
                                  20                         (3) Revising the tax laws applicable to the prop-
                                  21               erty and casualty insurance industry to permit care-
                                  22               fully controlled accumulation of pretax dollars in
                                  23               separate reserve funds devoted solely to the payment




                                  24               of claims arising from future major natural disasters
                                  25               will provide incentives for property and casualty in-

                                    1              surers to make natural disaster insurance available,
                                    2              will give greater protection to the Nation’s home-
                                    3              owners, small businesses, and other insurance con-
                                    4              sumers, and will help assure the future financial
                                    5              health of the Nation’s insurance system as a whole.
                                    6                        (4) Implementing these changes will reduce the
                                    7              possibility that a significant portion of the private
                                    8              insurance system would fail in the wake of a major
                                    9              natural disaster and that governmental entities
                                  10               would be required to step in to provide relief at tax-
                                  11               payer expense.
