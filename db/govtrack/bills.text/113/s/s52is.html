<p>To improve the energy and water efficiency of Federal buildings.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. PURPOSES.</h3>
<ul><p>The purposes of this Act are--</p><ul><p>(1) to require the General Services Administration to audit the energy performance of buildings owned by the General Services Administration and identify--</p><ul><p>(A) steps that can be taken to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs; and</p><p>(B) cost-savings that can be achieved by implementing energy efficiency measures;</p></ul><p>(2) to establish minimum efficiency standards for buildings leased by the Federal government;</p><p>(3) to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and</p><p>(4) to require regular reporting to Congress and the public on the energy use of Federal buildings and the cost-savings and pollution reduction associated with efficiency measures.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. ENERGY AUDITS OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) In General- Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, each energy manager (as defined in section 543(f)(1) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(1))) of a building owned by the General Services Administration shall carry out an audit of that building that--</p><ul><p>(1) identifies any modifications necessary to improve energy efficiency that, within 10 years of implementation, will result in energy cost savings equal to the total investment made; and</p><p>(2) quantifies the estimated cost-savings associated with any energy efficiency improvements identified by the energy manager.</p></ul><p>(b) Report- Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General Services shall report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives on--</p><ul><p>(1) all efficiency improvements identified in the audits carried out under subsection (a);</p><p>(2) the total estimated cost-savings associated with the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1); and</p><p>(3) the status of implementation of the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1).</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 4. IMPROVING EFFICIENCY OF LEASED BUILDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Section 435 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17091) is amended--</p><ul><p>(1) in subsection (b)(2), by striking &#8216;paragraph (2)&#8217; and inserting &#8216;paragraph (1)&#8217;;</p><p>(2) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (f); and</p><p>(3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:</p></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;(c) Other Efficiency Improvements- In accordance with subsection (d), beginning 1 year after the date of enactment of the Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act, each lease of a building or space in a building entered into by a Federal department or agency shall include, except under the conditions described in subparagraphs (B) through (D) of subsection (b)(1)--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) a maximum energy intensity standard;</p><p>&#8216;(2) a lighting efficiency requirement, accounting for appropriate task lighting; and</p><p>&#8216;(3) to the extent feasible, an incentive structure that allows the Federal department or agency leasing the building or space and the building owner to share the financial savings of efficiency investments and efficient operating practices.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(d) Standards-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) IN GENERAL- Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Administrator of General Services, on the advice of the Secretary, shall issue minimum standards under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c) that are designed to improve efficiency in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>&#8216;(2) UPDATES- The Secretary shall periodically review the standards under paragraph (1) and make any recommendations to the Administrator of General Services for revisions that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(e) Report-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) IN GENERAL- Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection and every 2 years thereafter, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, shall submit to Congress a report describing--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) the implementation by each Federal department or agency of this section; and</p><p>&#8216;(B) the extent to which each Federal department or agency has achieved compliance with the applicable requirements and standards of this section.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(2) RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING REPORTS- A report under paragraph (1) may be incorporated into a related or similar report of a Federal agency prepared by that Federal agency to meet other similar requirements.&#8217;.</p></ul></blockquote></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 5.
