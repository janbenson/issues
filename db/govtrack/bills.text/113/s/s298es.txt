 4   SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 5        Congress makes the following findings:
 6                  (1) On February 12, 2013, the Government of
 7        North Korea declared that it had conducted its third
 8        test of a nuclear device, following its first self-de-
 9        clared test on October 9, 2006, and its second test
10        on May 25, 2009.
11                  (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution
12        1718, adopted on October 14, 2006, condemned the
13        nuclear test proclaimed by North Korea on October
14        9, 2006, in flagrant disregard of its relevant resolu-
15        tions, in particular Security Council Resolution 1695
16        (2006), and demanded that North Korea not con-
17        duct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic
18        missile; immediately retract its announcement of
19        withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
20        of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London,
21        and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force
22        March 5, 1970 (NPT); and return to the NPT and
23        International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safe-
24        guards.
25                  (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution
26        1718 further decided that North Korea shall sus-
       † S 298 ES               3
 1      pend all activities related to its ballistic missile pro-
 2      gram and in this context re-establish its pre-existing
 3      commitments to a moratorium on missile launching;
 4      shall abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nu-
 5      clear programs in a complete, verifiable, and irre-
 6      versible manner; shall act strictly in accordance with
 7      the obligations applicable to parties under the NPT
 8      and the terms and conditions of its IAEA Safe-
 9      guards Agreement; shall provide the IAEA trans-
10      parency measures extending beyond these require-
11      ments, including such access to individuals, docu-
12      mentation, equipments and facilities as may be re-
13      quired and deemed necessary by the IAEA; and shall
14      abandon all other existing weapons of mass destruc-
15      tion (WMD) and its ballistic missile program in a
16      complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.
17                (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution
18      1718 also required United Nations Member States
19      to prevent—
20                    (A) transfers to, and procurement from,

15      sponsible for North Korea’s ballistic missile-related,
16      nuclear-related, or other weapons of mass destruc-
17      tion-related programs, and the immediate freezing of
18      funds, other financial assets, and economic resources
19      of persons or entities designated by the Security
20      Council or the 1718 Committee as being engaged in
21      or providing support for such programs, or by per-
22      sons or entities acting on their behalf or at their di-
23      rection.

 1                (6) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North

19                         (i) prevent the provision of financial
20                    services or the transfer to, through, or

 2                    vessels carrying them except where nec-
 3                    essary on humanitarian grounds.
 4                (8) On December 12, 2012, in flagrant defiance
 5      of past United Nations Security Council resolutions,
 6      the international community, and its Six-Party part-
 7      ners, the Government of North Korea launched a
 8      three-stage, long-range missile, which overflew Japa-
 9      nese territory near Okinawa and dropped debris into
10      the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and waters ad-
11      jacent to the Philippines.
12                (9) The United Nations Security Council adopt-
13      ed Security Council Resolution 2087 on January 22,
14      2013, which condemned North Korea’s December
15      12, 2012, missile launch as a breach of Security
16      Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, demanded that
17      North Korea ‘‘abandon all nuclear weapons and ex-
18      isting nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable,
19      and irreversible manner,’’ and expressed the deter-
20      mination of the Security Council ‘‘to take significant
21      action in the event of a further DPRK launch or nu-
22      clear test’’.
23                (10) the transition to the leadership of Kim
24      Jong-Un after the death of Kim Jong-Il has intro-
25      duced new uncertainties, yet the fundamental human

 1       rights and humanitarian conditions inside North
 2       Korea remain deplorable, thousands of North Kore-
 3       ans remain imprisoned in modern-day gulags, North
 4       Korean refugees remain acutely vulnerable, and the
 5       findings in the North Korean Human Rights Act of
 6       2004 (Public Law 108–333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et
 7       seq.), the North Korean Human Rights Reauthoriza-
 8       tion Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–346), and the

12       main substantially accurate today.
13                 (11) There has been extensive military coopera-
14       tion between the Governments of North Korea and
15       Iran that dates back to the 1980s.
16                 (12) The latest provocative and defiant action
17       by the Government of North Korea represents a di-
18       rect threat to the United States and to our regional
19       allies and partners.
20   SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
21       It is the sense of Congress that—
22                 (1) the test of a nuclear device by the Govern-
23       ment of North Korea on February 12, 2013, and the

 2      (2006), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009), the test of

 4      deliberate, and provocative violation of United Na-
 5      tions Security Resolution 2087 (2013), and the Gov-
 6      ernment of North Korea continues to defy the

17      ance with all United Nations Security Council reso-
18      lutions and its commitments under the 2005 Joint
19      Statement of the Six-Party Talks;
20                (4) restrictions against the Government of
21      North Korea, including sanctions that ban the im-
22      portation into the United States of unlicensed North
23      Korean products and goods, should remain in effect
24      until the Government of North Korea no longer en-

 5      sanctions, including the public identification of all
 6      North Korean and foreign banks, business, and gov-
 7      ernment agencies suspected of conduct that violates
 8      United Nations Security Council resolutions, and im-
 9      plementing necessary measures to ensure enforce-
10      ment of such sanctions;
11                (6) all United Nations Member States should—
12                     (A) further strengthen efforts to prevent
13                the transfer of military and dual-use tech-
14                nologies to North Korea, including an expan-
15                sion of the list of sanctioned materials identi-
16                fied by the United Nations Panel of Experts on
17                North Korea sanctions and the items on the
