<p>To prohibit brand name drug companies from compensating generic drug companies to delay the entry of a generic drug into the market.</p><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Findings- Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 98-417) (referred to in this Act as the &#8216;1984 Act&#8217;), was enacted with the intent of facilitating the early entry of generic drugs while preserving incentives for innovation.</p><p>(2) Prescription drugs make up 10 percent of the national health care spending but for the past decade have been one of the fastest growing segments of health care expenditures.</p><p>(3) Until recently, the 1984 Act was successful in facilitating generic competition to the benefit of consumers and health care payers--although 67 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United States are generic drugs, they account for only 20 percent of all expenditures.</p><p>(4) Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name drugs, with discounts off the brand price sometimes exceeding 90 percent.</p><p>(5) Federal dollars currently account for an estimated 35 percent of the $263,000,000,000 spent on prescription drugs, and this share is expected to rise to 42 percent by 2021.</p><p>(6)(A) In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been subverted by certain settlement agreements between brand companies and their potential generic competitors that make &#8216;reverse payments&#8217; which are payments by the brand company to the generic company.</p><p>(B) These settlement agreements have unduly delayed the marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free competition, the interests of consumers, and the principles underlying antitrust law.</p><p>(C) Because of the price disparity between brand name and generic drugs, such agreements are more profitable for both the brand and generic manufacturers than competition, and will become increasingly common unless prohibited.</p><p>(D) These agreements result in consumers losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to provide.</p></ul><p>(b) Purposes- The purposes of this Act are--</p><ul><p>(1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent competition from generic drugs; and</p><p>(2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry that harm consumers.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.</h3>
<ul><p>The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by--</p><ul><p>(1) redesignating section 28 as section 29; and</p><p>(2) inserting before section 29, as redesignated, the following:</p></ul></ul><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 28.

<ul><p>&#8216;(a) In General-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDING- The Federal Trade Commission may initiate a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section against the parties to any agreement resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis, a patent infringement claim, in connection with the sale of a drug product.</p><p>&#8216;(2) PRESUMPTION-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) IN GENERAL- Subject to subparagraph (B), in such a proceeding, an agreement shall be presumed to have anticompetitive effects and be unlawful if--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) an ANDA filer receives anything of value; and</p><p>&#8216;(ii) the ANDA filer agrees to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product for any period of time.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(B) EXCEPTION- The presumption in subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the parties to such agreement demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the procompetitive benefits of the agreement outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the agreement.</p></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(b) Competitive Factors- In determining whether the settling parties have met their burden under subsection (a)(2)(B), the fact finder shall consider--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) the length of time remaining until the end of the life of the relevant patent, compared with the agreed upon entry date for the ANDA product;</p><p>&#8216;(2) the value to consumers of the competition from the ANDA product allowed under the agreement;</p><p>&#8216;(3) the form and amount of consideration received by the ANDA filer in the agreement resolving or settling the patent infringement claim;</p><p>&#8216;(4) the revenue the ANDA filer would have received by winning the patent litigation;</p><p>&#8216;(5) the reduction in the NDA holder&#8217;s revenues if it had lost the patent litigation;</p><p>&#8216;(6) the time period between the date of the agreement conveying value to the ANDA filer and the date of the settlement of the patent infringement claim; and</p><p>&#8216;(7) any other factor that the fact finder, in its discretion, deems relevant to its determination of competitive effects under this subsection.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(c) Limitations- In determining whether the settling parties have met their burden under subsection (a)(2)(B), the fact finder shall not presume--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) that entry would not have occurred until the expiration of the relevant patent or statutory exclusivity; or</p><p>&#8216;(2) that the agreement&#8217;s provision for entry of the ANDA product prior to the expiration of the relevant patent or statutory exclusivity means that the agreement is pro-competitive, although such evidence may be relevant to the fact finder&#8217;s determination under this section.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(d) Exclusions- Nothing in this section shall prohibit a resolution or settlement of a patent infringement claim in which the consideration granted by the NDA holder to the ANDA filer as part of the resolution or settlement includes only one or more of the following:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) The right to market the ANDA product in the United States prior to the expiration of--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) any patent that is the basis for the patent infringement claim; or</p><p>&#8216;(B) any patent right or other statutory exclusivity that would prevent the marketing of such drug.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(2) A payment for reasonable litigation expenses not to exceed $7,500,000.</p><p>&#8216;(3) A covenant not to sue on any claim that the ANDA product infringes a United States patent.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(e) Regulations and Enforcement-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) REGULATIONS- The Federal Trade Commission may issue, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, regulations implementing and interpreting this section.

Such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the Federal Trade Commission, in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, in a district court of the United States against any person, partnership or corporation that violates this section.
