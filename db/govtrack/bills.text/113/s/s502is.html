</blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 1841. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>&#8216;Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) Investments in children and early childhood development education should be a national priority.</p><p>&#8216;(2) State-funded preschool is the most rapidly expanding segment of the United States educational system, but in many States a lack of stable funding poses an enormous threat to the provision or continuation of high-quality preschool.</p><p>&#8216;(3) Researchers, educators, and economists have long noted an achievement gap for low-income and minority students as compared to their more advantaged peers that is often already evident when children enter school for the first time.</p><p>&#8216;(4) One study showed that before entering kindergarten, the average cognitive scores of preschool-age children in the highest socioeconomic group are 60 percent above the average scores of preschool-age children in the lowest socioeconomic group.</p><p>&#8216;(5) For low-income preschoolers, research shows that high-quality early education and development is vital to closing the achievement gap between them and their more advantaged peers.</p><p>&#8216;(6) Numerous studies have shown that high-quality preschool programs--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) improve a number of specific life outcomes for children; and</p><p>&#8216;(B) are cost-effective.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(7) The provision of high-quality prekindergarten is a cost-effective investment for children and for the Nation. Research shows that for every $1 invested in high-quality early childhood programs, taxpayers save up to $7 in crime, welfare, remedial and special education, and other costs.</p><p>&#8216;(8) High-quality early education increases academic success for schoolchildren who received that education by--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) improving skills in areas such as following directions and problem solving;</p><p>&#8216;(B) improving students&#8217; performance on standardized tests;</p><p>&#8216;(C) reducing grade repetition;</p><p>&#8216;(D) reducing the number of students placed in special education; and</p><p>&#8216;(E) increasing secondary school graduation rates.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(9) High-quality early education promotes responsible behavior by teens and adults who received that education by--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) reducing crime, delinquency, and unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and drug use;</p><p>&#8216;(B) lowering rates of teen pregnancy;</p><p>&#8216;(C) leading to greater employment and higher wages for adults; and</p><p>&#8216;(D) contributing to more stable families.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(10) High-quality prekindergarten programs prepare children to--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) succeed in school;</p><p>&#8216;(B) achieve higher levels of education; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) become citizens who--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) earn more in adulthood;</p><p>&#8216;(ii) compete in the global economy; and</p><p>&#8216;(iii) contribute to our national prosperity.</p></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(11) The gap in developmental progress prior to preschool is significant for thousands of young children, and needs to be addressed in order to have a strong foundation for children&#8217;s progress in preschool and later years.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 1842.
