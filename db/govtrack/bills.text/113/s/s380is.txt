                                    4              problems, while at the same time facing barriers to
                                    5              receiving appropriate mental health care.
                                    6                        (2) According to the National Institute of Men-

                                  12               post traumatic stress disorder), only 18 percent re-
                                  13               ceived services. Half of all lifetime cases of mental

                                  15               treatments that have been developed, there are long
                                  16               delays, sometimes decades, between first onset of

                                    7              of Mental Health reported that adults who were
                                    8              abused or neglected as children have increased risk
                                    9              of major depression, often beginning in childhood
                                  10               with long-lasting effects.
                                  11                         (6) According to the Department of Defense,
                                  12               more than 700,000 children have experienced one or
                                  13               more parental deployments. Children’s reactions to a
                                  14               parent’s deployment vary by a child’s developmental
                                  15               stage, age, and presence of any preexisting psycho-
                                  16               logical or behavioral problems. The mental health of

                                  18               distress level. Parents reporting clinically significant
                                  19               stress are more likely to have children identified as
