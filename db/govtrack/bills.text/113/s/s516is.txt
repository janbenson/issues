                                    8              Congress makes the following findings:
                                    9                        (1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause
                                  10               of cancer death among men.
                                  11                         (2) In 2010, more than 217,730 new patients
                                  12               were diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than
                                  13               32,000 men died from this disease.
                                  14                         (3) Roughly 2,000,000 Americans are living
                                  15               with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and its con-
                                  16               sequences.
                                  17                         (4) While prostate cancer generally affects older
                                  18               individuals, younger men are also at risk for the dis-
                                  19               ease, and when prostate cancer appears in early
                                  20               middle age it frequently takes on a more aggressive




                                  21               form.

                                    1                        (5) There are significant racial and ethnic dis-
                                    2              parities that demand attention, namely African-
                                    3              Americans have prostate cancer mortality rates that
                                    4              are more than double those in the White population.
                                    5                        (6) Underserved rural populations have higher
                                    6              rates of mortality compared to their urban counter-
                                    7              parts, and innovative and cost-efficient methods to

                                    9              advantage of advances in telehealth to diagnose and

                                  11                         (7) Certain veterans populations may have
                                  12               nearly twice the incidence of prostate cancer as the
                                  13               general population of the United States.
                                  14                         (8) Urologists may constitute the specialists
                                  15               who diagnose and treat the vast majority of prostate
                                  16               cancer patients.
                                  17                         (9) Although much basic and translational re-
                                  18               search has been completed and much is currently
                                  19               known, there are still many unanswered questions.
                                  20               For example, it is not fully understood how much of
                                  21               known disparities are attributable to disease eti-
                                  22               ology, access to care, or education and awareness in
                                  23               the community.
                                  24                         (10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known.

                                    2              and indolent forms of the disease. As a result, there
                                    3              is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer.
                                    4              There are no treatments that can durably arrest

                                    7                        (11) A significant proportion (roughly 23 to 54
