<ul><p>Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>(1) Academically gifted and talented students make up an estimated 6 to 10 percent of the prekindergarten through grade 12 student population, totaling between 3,000,000 and 6,000,000 students.</p><p>(2) There is a growing excellence gap at the highest levels of achievement between the performance of subgroups of students, particularly between the performance of students who are African-American or Hispanic and the performance of White students, and between low-income students compared to their more advantaged peers, on statewide assessments and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress.</p><p>(3) Advanced students in the United States lag behind the performance of similar students in other countries, which puts the Nation at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>(4) Gifted and talented students, and high-ability students who have not been formally identified for gifted education services, require modifications to the general education curriculum to fully meet their potential.</p><p>(5) Effective assessment and instruction of gifted and talented students requires educators to have specialized knowledge and skills.</p><p>(6) Ninety percent of teachers nationwide want more professional development focused on the skills necessary for teaching advanced students.</p><p>(7) Interventions and strategies that have been demonstrated to be successful with gifted and talented students can be modified to improve the achievement of all students.</p><p>(8) The availability of gifted education programs and services to students who require such services is unequal and often relies solely on local resources and leadership, leaving many high-ability students from rural areas or who are English language learners or Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, among others, without access to appropriate services.</p><p>(9) There are an estimated 360,000 students in the United States who are both gifted and have a disability. These &#8216;twice exceptional&#8217; children present special challenges because their disability often masks their academic potential or their academic strengths may mask their disability, resulting in a lack of services and supports for this student population.</p><p>(10) The development and dissemination of research and national data on gifted and talented students is necessary to--</p><ul><p>(A) guide evidence-based classroom practices vital to meeting the unique needs of this population of students; and</p><p>(B) contribute to the decisionmaking of educators, families, and policymakers.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
