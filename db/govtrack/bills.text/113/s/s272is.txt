                                    8                        (2) The Arctic region of the United States is
                                    9              home to an indigenous population that has subsisted
                                  10               for millennia on the abundance in marine mammals,
                                  11               fish, and wildlife, many of which are unique to the
                                  12               region.
                                  13                         (3) Temperatures in the United States Arctic

                                  15               the past half-century, a rate of increase that is twice
                                  16               the global average.
                                  17                         (4) The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing

                                  19               pheric Administration estimates the Arctic Ocean
                                  20               may be ice free during summer months in as few as
                                  21               30 years.
                                  22                         (5) Such changes to the Arctic region are hav-

                                    3                        (6) Such changes are opening new portions of

                                  13                         (8) The lack of research integration and syn-

                                  18                         (9) An improved scientific understanding of the
