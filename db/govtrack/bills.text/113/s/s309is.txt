                                    2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
                                    3     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
                                    4              Congress makes the following findings:
                                    5                        (1) The unpaid volunteer members of the Civil
                                    6              Air Patrol (hereafter in this Act referred to as the
                                    7              ‘‘CAP’’) during World War II provided extraor-

                                    9              during a critical time of need for the Nation.
                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (2) During the war, CAP members used their
                                    2              own aircraft to perform a myriad of essential tasks
                                    3              for the military and the Nation within the United
                                    4              States, including attacks on enemy submarines off
                                    5              the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United
                                    6              States.
                                    7                        (3) This extraordinary national service set the
                                    8              stage for the post-war CAP to become a valuable
                                    9              nonprofit, public service organization chartered by
                                  10               Congress and designated the Auxiliary of the United

                                  12               operational, and public services to communities,
                                  13               States, the Federal Government, and the military.
                                  14                         (4) The CAP was established on December 1,
                                  15               1941, initially as a part of the Office of Civil De-
                                  16               fense, by air-minded citizens one week before the
                                  17               surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, out of the
                                  18               desire of civil airmen of the country to be mobilized
                                  19               with their equipment in the common defense of the
                                  20               Nation.
                                  21                         (5) Within days of the start of the war, the
                                  22               German Navy started a massive submarine offensive,
                                  23               known as Operation Drumbeat, off the east coast of
                                  24               the United States against oil tankers and other crit-




                                  25               ical shipping that threatened the overall war effort.

                                                                                             3
                                    1                        (6) Neither the Navy nor the Army had enough
                                    2              aircraft, ships, or other resources to adequately pa-
                                    3              trol and protect the shipping along the Atlantic and
                                    4              Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, and
                                    5              many ships were torpedoed and sunk, often within
                                    6              sight of civilians on shore, including 52 tankers sunk
                                    7              between January and March 1942.
                                    8                        (7) At that time General George Marshall re-
                                    9              marked that ‘‘[t]he losses by submarines off our At-
                                  10               lantic seaboard and in the Caribbean now threaten
                                  11               our entire war effort’’.
                                  12                         (8) From the beginning CAP leaders urged the
                                  13               military to use its services to patrol coastal waters
                                  14               but met with great resistance because of the non-
                                  15               military status of CAP civilian pilots.
                                  16                         (9) Finally, in response to the ever-increasing
                                  17               submarine attacks, the Tanker Committee of the Pe-
                                  18               troleum Industry War Council urged the Navy De-
                                  19               partment and the War Department to consider the
                                  20               use of the CAP to help patrol the sea lanes off the
                                  21               coasts of the United States.
                                  22                         (10) While the Navy initially rejected this sug-
                                  23               gestion, the Army decided it had merit, and the Civil
                                  24               Air Patrol Coastal Patrol began in March 1942.

                                                                                             4
                                    1                        (11) Oil companies and other organizations pro-
                                    2              vided funds to help pay for some CAP operations,
                                    3              including vitally needed shore radios that were used
                                    4              to monitor patrol missions.
                                    5                        (12) By late March 1942, the Navy also began
                                    6              to use the services of the CAP.
                                    7                        (13) Starting with 3 bases located in Delaware,
                                    8              Florida, and New Jersey, CAP aircrews (ranging in
                                    9              age from 18 to over 80) immediately started to spot
                                  10               enemy submarines as well as lifeboats, bodies, and
                                  11               wreckage.
                                  12                         (14) Within 15 minutes of starting his patrol
                                  13               on the first Coastal Patrol flight, a pilot had sighted
                                  14               a torpedoed tanker and was coordinating rescue op-
                                  15               erations.
                                  16                         (15) Eventually 21 bases, ranging from Bar
                                  17               Harbor, Maine, to Brownsville, Texas, were set up
                                  18               for the CAP to patrol the Atlantic and Gulf of Mex-
                                  19               ico coasts of the United States, with 40,000 volun-

                                  22               owned aircraft, mainly light-weight, single-engine
                                  23               aircraft manufactured by Cessna, Beech, Waco,
                                  24               Fairchild, Stinson, Piper, Taylorcraft, and Sikorsky,

                                    1              among others, as well as some twin engine aircraft,
                                    2              such as the Grumman Widgeon.
                                    3                        (17) Most of these aircraft were painted in
                                    4              their civilian prewar colors (red, yellow, or blue, for
                                    5              example) and carried special markings (a blue circle
                                    6              with a white triangle) to identify them as CAP air-
                                    7              craft.
                                    8                        (18) Patrols were conducted up to 100 miles off
                                    9              shore, generally with 2 aircraft flying together, in
                                  10               aircraft often equipped with only a compass for navi-
                                  11               gation and a single radio for communication.
                                  12                         (19) Due to the critical nature of the situation,
                                  13               CAP operations were conducted in bad weather as
                                  14               well as good, often when the military was unable to
                                  15               fly, and in all seasons, including the winter, when
                                  16               ditching an aircraft in cold water would likely mean
                                  17               certain death to the aircrew.
                                  18                         (20) Personal emergency equipment was often
                                  19               lacking, particularly during early patrols where inner
                                  20               tubes and kapok duck hunter vests were carried as

                                    8              across a surfaced submarine that quickly stranded
