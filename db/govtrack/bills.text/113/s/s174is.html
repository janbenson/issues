<p>To appropriately restrict sales of ammunition.</p><p/><center><p>IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES</p></center>
<p/><h3><center><p>January 29, 2013</p></center></h3>
<p>Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. MURPHY, and Mr. LAUTENBERG) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary</p><hr/><p/><center><p>A BILL</p></center>
<p>To appropriately restrict sales of ammunition.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Ammunition Background Check Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Under current Federal law, it is illegal to sell firearms or ammunition to certain individuals, including felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and those deemed &#8216;mentally defective&#8217; or committed to a mental institution.</p><p>(2) There is no requirement under Federal law that sellers of ammunition conduct a background check to determine whether potential purchasers are in fact prohibited by law from buying ammunition.</p><p>(3) By contrast, under current Federal law, licensed sellers of firearms are required by law to conduct an instant background check using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System of the Justice Department.</p><p>(4) Over the last decade, there have been over 100,000,000 background checks conducted under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with respect to firearms sales, resulting in the blocking of more than 1,500,000 sales of firearms to felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, among others.</p><p>(5) The vast majority of instant background checks on firearms purchases occur in an average of 30 seconds, at minimal inconvenience to firearms sellers and law-abiding purchasers.</p><p>(6) The requirement of background checks for ammunition purchases would pose a minimal inconvenience to ammunition sellers and law-abiding purchasers, and would help reduce gun-related violence.</p><p>(7) Current Federal law includes a variety of other provisions regulating the sale of firearms, including limits on interstate gun sales and recordkeeping requirements designed to assist in criminal investigations, that do not apply to sales of ammunition.</p><p>(8) Sales of ammunition should be held to similar requirements as sales of firearms.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Requiring Background Checks for Purchases of Ammunition-</p><ul><p>(1) IN GENERAL- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after subsection (u) the following:</p></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;(v)(1) On and after the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of the Ammunition Background Check Act of 2013, no person who is licensed under this chapter shall transfer ammunition to any other person who is not licensed under this chapter, unless--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) before the completion of the transfer, the licensee contacts the national instant criminal background check system established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act;</p><p>&#8216;(B)(i) the system provides the licensee with a unique identification number; or</p><p>&#8216;(ii) 3 business days (meaning a day on which State offices are open) have elapsed since the licensee contacted the system, and the system has not notified the licensee that the receipt of a firearm by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of this section; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) the transferor has verified the identity of the transferee by examining a valid identification document (as defined in section 1028(d) of this title) of the transferee containing a photograph of the transferee.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(2) If receipt of ammunition would not violate subsection (g) or (n) or State law, the system shall--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) assign a unique identification number to the transfer;</p><p>&#8216;(B) provide the licensee with the number; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) destroy all records of the system with respect to the call (other than the identifying number and the date the number was assigned) and all records of the system relating to the person or the transfer.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an ammunition transfer between a licensee and another person if--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A)(i) such other person has presented to the licensee a permit that--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(I) allows such other person to possess or acquire ammunition; and</p><p>&#8216;(II) was issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in which the transfer is to take place; and</p></ul><p>&#8216;(ii) the law of the State provides that such a permit is to be issued only after an authorized government official has verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a firearm or ammunition by such other person would be in violation of law;</p><p>&#8216;(B) the Attorney General has approved the transfer under section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or</p><p>&#8216;(C) on application of the transferor, the Attorney General has certified that compliance with paragraph (1)(A) is impracticable because--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) the ratio of the number of law enforcement officers of the State in which the transfer is to occur to the number of square miles of land area of the State does not exceed 0.0025;</p><p>&#8216;(ii) the business premises of the licensee at which the transfer is to occur are extremely remote in relation to the chief law enforcement officer (as defined in subsection (s)(8)); and</p><p>&#8216;(iii) there is an absence of telecommunications facilities in the geographical area in which the business premises are located.</p></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(4) If the national instant criminal background check system notifies any person licensed under this chapter that the information available to the system does not demonstrate that the receipt of ammunition by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) or State law, and the licensee transfers ammunition to such other person, the seller shall include in the record of the transfer the unique identification number provided by the system with respect to the transfer.</p><p>&#8216;(5) If any person licensed under this chapter knowingly transfers ammunition to another person and knowingly fails to comply with paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to the transfer and, at the time such other person most recently proposed the transfer, the national instant criminal background check system was operating and information was available to the system demonstrating that receipt of ammunition by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of this section or State law, the Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend for not more than 6 months or revoke any license issued to the person under section 923, and may impose on the person a civil fine of not more than $5,000 for a first violation, $25,000 for a second violation, and $100,000 for any subsequent violation.</p><p>&#8216;(6) Neither a local government nor an employee of the Federal Government or of any State or local government, responsible for providing information to the national instant criminal background check system shall be liable in an action at law for damages--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) for failure to prevent the sale or transfer of ammunition to a person whose receipt or possession of the ammunition is unlawful under this section; or</p><p>&#8216;(B) for preventing such a sale or transfer to a person who may lawfully receive or possess ammunition.&#8217;.</p><p>(2) REGULATIONS RELATING TO RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS IN SYSTEM- In promulgating regulations to carry out subsection (v)(2)(C) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as added by this Act, the Attorney General shall ensure that the records described in such subsection are destroyed not later than 3 business days after the date on which a licensee is notified that a transfer of ammunition may proceed under such section.</p><p>(3) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS-</p><ul><p>(A) TITLE 18- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--</p><ul><p>(i) in subsection (c)--</p><ul><p>(I) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by inserting &#8216;or ammunition&#8217;
