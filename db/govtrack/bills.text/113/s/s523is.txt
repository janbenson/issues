                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Private sector business concerns, which are
                                    2              free to respond to the private or public demands of
                                    3              the marketplace, constitute the strength of the
                                    4              United States economic system.
                                    5                        (2) Competitive private enterprises are the most
                                    6              productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods
                                    7              and services.
                                    8                        (3) Unfair Government competition with the
                                    9              private sector of the economy is detrimental to the
                                  10               United States economic system.
                                  11                         (4) Unfair Government competition with the
                                  12               private sector of the economy is at an unacceptably
                                  13               high level, both in scope and in dollar volume.
                                  14                         (5) Current law and policy have failed to ad-
                                  15               dress adequately the problem of unfair Government
                                  16               competition with the private sector of the economy.
                                  17                         (6) It is in the public interest that the Federal
                                  18               Government establish a consistent policy to rely on
                                  19               the private sector of the economy to provide goods
                                  20               and services necessary for or beneficial to the oper-

                                  22               avoid unfair Government competition with the pri-
                                  23               vate sector of the economy.

                                    8              (a) POLICY.—In the process of governing, the Fed-
                                    9 eral Government should not compete with its citizens. The
                                  10 competitive enterprise system, characterized by individual
                                  11 freedom and initiative, is the primary source of national
                                  12 economic strength. In recognition of this principle, it has
                                  13 been and continues to be the general policy of the Federal
                                  14 Government—
                                  15                         (1) to rely on commercial sources to supply the
                                  16               products and services the Government needs;
                                  17                         (2) to refrain from providing a product or serv-
                                  18               ice if the product or service can be procured more
                                  19               economically from a commercial source; and
                                  20                         (3) to utilize Federal employees to perform in-
                                  21               herently governmental functions (as that term is de-
