<ul><p nid="t0:is:16">(a) Findings-</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:17">(1) EFFECT ON HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND COSTS- Congress finds that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting patient access to health care services, better patient care, and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for resolving claims of health care liability and compensating injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of information among health care professionals which impedes efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.</p><p nid="t0:is:18">(2) EFFECT ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE- Congress finds that the health care and insurance industries are industries affecting interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation systems existing throughout the United States are activities that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high costs of health care and premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by health care system providers.</p><p nid="t0:is:19">(3) EFFECT ON FEDERAL SPENDING- Congress finds that the health care liability litigation systems existing throughout the United States have a significant effect on the amount, distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:20">(A) the large number of individuals who receive health care benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal Government;</p><p nid="t0:is:21">(B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to provide them with health insurance benefits; and</p><p nid="t0:is:22">(C) the large number of health care providers who provide items or services for which the Federal Government makes payments.</p></ul></ul><p nid="t0:is:23">(b) Purpose- It is the purpose of this Act to implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care liability reforms designed to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:24">(1) improve the availability of health care services in cases in which health care liability actions have been shown to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;</p><p nid="t0:is:25">(2) reduce the incidence of &#x2018;defensive medicine&#x2019; and lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;</p><p nid="t0:is:26">(3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including reasonable noneconomic damages;</p><p nid="t0:is:27">(4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our current health care liability system to resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided to injured individuals; and</p><p nid="t0:is:28">(5) provide an increased sharing of information in the health care system which will reduce unintended injury and improve patient care.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:29">SEC. 3.
