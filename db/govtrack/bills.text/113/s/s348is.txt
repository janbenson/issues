                                              IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
                                                               FEBRUARY 14, 2013

                                    7              Congress makes the following findings:





                                    8                        (1) Nonmedical use of prescription pain reliev-
                                    9              ers is a matter of increasing public health concern.


                                                                                             2
                                    1              According to the Substance Abuse and Mental
                                    2              Health Services Administration, the proportion of all
                                    3              substance abuse treatment admissions aged 12 or
                                    4              older that reported any pain reliever abuse increased
                                    5              more than 400 percent between 1998 and 2008,
                                    6              from 2.2 to 9.8 percent.
                                    7                        (2) In 2008, among the population of the
                                    8              United States aged 12 or older, nonmedical use of
                                    9              prescription pain relievers was the second most prev-
                                  10               alent type of illicit drug use, after marijuana use.
                                  11                         (3) When used properly under medical super-
                                  12               vision, prescription opiates enable individuals with
                                  13               chronic pain to lead productive lives. However, when
                                  14               taken without a physician’s oversight and direction,
                                  15               opiates can cause serious adverse health effects, re-
                                  16               sulting in dependence, abuse, and death.
                                  17                         (4) As with any controlled substance, there is a
                                  18               risk of abuse of methadone and other opiates.
                                  19                         (5) Methadone is an extensively tested, federally
                                  20               approved, and widely accepted method of treating
                                  21               addiction to prescription pain relievers or opiates.
                                  22                         (6) For more than 30 years, this synthetic pre-
                                  23               scription drug has been used for pain management




                                  24               and treatment for addiction to heroin, morphine,

                                    1                        (7) The efficacy and lower cost of methadone
                                    2              has resulted in its being prescribed for pain manage-
                                    3              ment.
                                    4                        (8) Prescriptions for methadone have increased
                                    5              by nearly 700 percent from 1998 through 2006.
                                    6                        (9) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
                                    7              trol and Prevention, the number of poisoning deaths
                                    8              involving methadone increased nearly 7-fold from al-
                                    9              most 790 in 1999 to almost 5,420 in 2006, which
                                  10               is the most rapid increase among opioid analgesics
                                  11               and other narcotics involved in poisoning deaths.
                                  12                         (10) The age-specific rates of methadone death
                                  13               are higher for persons age 35 to 44 and 45 to 54
                                  14               than for other age groups. However, the rate of
                                  15               methadone deaths in younger individuals (age 15 to
                                  16               24) increased 11-fold from 1999 through 2005.
                                  17                         (11) Deaths from methadone and other opiates
                                  18               may actually be underreported. There is no com-
                                  19               prehensive database of drug-related deaths in the
                                  20               United States.
                                  21                         (12) The lack of standardized reporting by
                                  22               Medical Examiners precludes a uniform definition of

                                    9                        (14) Current Federal oversight of methadone
                                  10               and other opioids is inadequate to address the grow-

                                  12                         (15) Federal legislation is needed to avert
                                  13               opioid abuse, misuse, and death, without reducing
