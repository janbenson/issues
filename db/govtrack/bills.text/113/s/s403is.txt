                                    8                        (1) Bullying and harassment foster a climate of

                                    2              create conditions that negatively affect learning,
                                    3              thereby undermining the ability of students to
                                    4              achieve their full potential.
                                    5                        (2) Bullying and harassment contribute to high
                                    6              dropout rates, increased absenteeism, and academic
                                    7              underachievement.
                                    8                        (3) Bullying and harassment include a range of
                                    9              behaviors that negatively impact a student’s ability
                                  10               to learn and participate in educational opportunities
                                  11               and activities that schools offer. Such behaviors can
                                  12               include hitting or punching, name-calling, intimida-
                                  13               tion through gestures or social exclusion, and send-

                                  18                         (4) Schools with enumerated anti-bullying and
                                  19               harassment policies have an increased level of re-
                                  20               porting and teacher intervention in incidents of bul-
                                  21               lying and harassment, thereby reducing the overall
                                  22               frequency and number of such incidents.

                                  14               practices, can minimize suspensions, expulsions, and
                                  15               other exclusionary discipline policies to ensure that
                                  16               students are not ‘‘pushed-out’’ or diverted to the ju-

                                  18                         (8) According to one poll, 85 percent of Ameri-
