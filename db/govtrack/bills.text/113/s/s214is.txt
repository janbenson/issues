                                    7                        (1) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and

                                    9              (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘1984 Act’’), was en-


                                                                                             2
                                    1              acted with the intent of facilitating the early entry
                                    2              of generic drugs while preserving incentives for inno-
                                    3              vation.
                                    4                        (2) Prescription drugs make up 10 percent of

                                    7              ments of health care expenditures.
                                    8                        (3) Until recently, the 1984 Act was successful
                                    9              in facilitating generic competition to the benefit of
                                  10               consumers and health care payers—although 67 per-

                                  12               States are generic drugs, they account for only 20
                                  13               percent of all expenditures.
                                  14                         (4) Generic drugs cost substantially less than
                                  15               brand name drugs, with discounts off the brand
                                  16               price sometimes exceeding 90 percent.
                                  17                         (5) Federal dollars currently account for an es-
                                  18               timated 35 percent of the $263,000,000,000 spent
                                  19               on prescription drugs, and this share is expected to
                                  20               rise to 42 percent by 2021.
                                  21                         (6)(A) In recent years, the intent of the 1984
                                  22               Act has been subverted by certain settlement agree-
                                  23               ments between brand companies and their potential
                                  24               generic competitors that make ‘‘reverse payments’’

                                    3                        (B) These settlement agreements have unduly
                                    4              delayed the marketing of low-cost generic drugs con-

                                    6              and the principles underlying antitrust law.
                                    7                        (C) Because of the price disparity between
                                    8              brand name and generic drugs, such agreements are
                                    9              more profitable for both the brand and generic man-
                                  10               ufacturers than competition, and will become in-
                                  11               creasingly common unless prohibited.
                                  12                         (D) These agreements result in consumers los-
                                  13               ing the benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to
                                  14               provide.
                                  15               (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are—
                                  16                         (1) to enhance competition in the pharma-

                                  18               ments between brand name and generic drug manu-
