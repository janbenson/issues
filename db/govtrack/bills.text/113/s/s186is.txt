                                    2              since the lives of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair,
                                    3              Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, known as
                                    4              the ‘‘4 little Black girls’’, were suddenly taken by a

                                    6              Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
                                    7                        (2) The senseless and premature death of the
                                    8              4 little Black girls sparked ‘‘The Movement that
                                    9              Changed the World’’.
                                  10                         (3) On that tragic Sunday in September of
                                  11               1963, the world took notice of the violence inflicted

                                  13                         (4) The fact that 4 innocent children lost their
                                  14               lives as they prepared for Sunday School shook the
                                  15               world’s conscience.
                                  16                         (5) This tragedy galvanized the Civil Rights
                                  17               Movement and sparked a surge of momentum that
                                  18               helped secure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
                                  19               1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
                                  20               which were signed into law by President Lyndon B.

                                  22                         (6) Justice was delayed for these 4 little Black
                                  23               girls and their families until 2002, 39 years after
                                  24               the bombing, when the last of the Klansmen respon-




                                  25               sible for the bombing was convicted of the crime.

                                    1                        (7) The 4 little Black girls are emblematic of
                                    2              so many who have lost their lives for the cause of
                                    3              freedom and equality, including Virgil Ware and
                                    4              Johnny Robinson, who were children also killed
                                    5              within hours of the 1963 church bombing.
                                    6                        (8) The legacy that these 4 little Black girls left
                                    7              will live on in the minds and hearts of us all for gen-

                                    9                        (9) Their extraordinary sacrifice sparked real
                                  10               and lasting change as Congress began to aggres-
                                  11               sively pass legislation that ensured equality.
                                  12                         (10) Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remains a
                                  13               powerful symbol of the movement for civil and
