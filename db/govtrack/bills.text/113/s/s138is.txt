                                    7              contexts, including the provision of employment,

                                  16               In addition to medically assisted sex determination,
                                  17               a growing sex determination niche industry has de-

                                    3                        (4) A ‘‘sex-selection abortion’’ is an abortion
                                    4              undertaken for purposes of eliminating an unborn
                                    5              child based on the sex or gender of the child. Sex-
                                    6              selection abortion is barbaric, and described by
                                    7              scholars and civil rights advocates as an act of sex-
                                    8              based or gender-based violence, predicated on sex
                                    9              discrimination. Sex-selection abortions are typically
                                  10               late-term abortions performed in the 2nd or 3rd tri-
                                  11               mester of pregnancy, after the unborn child has de-
                                  12               veloped sufficiently to feel pain. Substantial medical
                                  13               evidence proves that an unborn child can experience
                                  14               pain at 20 weeks after conception, and perhaps sub-

                                  16               tions do not implicate the health of the mother of
                                  17               the unborn, but instead are elective procedures moti-
                                  18               vated by sex or gender bias.

                                  21               are overwhelmingly female. The selective abortion of
                                  22               females is female infanticide, the intentional killing
                                  23               of unborn females, due to the preference for male
                                  24               offspring or ‘‘son preference’’. Son preference is re-

                                    5              provide financially for the family unit as can a male.
                                    6              In addition, due to social and legal convention, fe-
                                    7              male offspring are less likely to carry on the family

                                    9              manifestations of sex or gender discrimination in

                                  14               prohibited by United States law or the laws of 47
                                  15               States. Sex-selection abortions are performed in the
                                  16               United States. In a March 2008 report published in
                                  17               the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                                  18               Sciences, Columbia University economists Douglas
                                  19               Almond and Lena Edlund examined the sex ratio of
                                  20               United States-born children and found ‘‘evidence of
                                  21               sex selection, most likely at the prenatal stage’’. The
                                  22               data revealed obvious ‘‘son preference’’ in the form

                                    2              prevalent. The evidence strongly suggests that some
                                    3              Americans are exercising sex-selection abortion prac-

                                    8              outside the United States, the evidence reveals that
                                    9              female feticide is also occurring in the United
                                  10               States.

                                  12               of sex-selection abortion. In a March 2006 Zogby
                                  13               International poll, 86 percent of Americans agreed
                                  14               that sex-selection abortion should be illegal, yet only

                                  17               proscribe sex-selection abortion, the United States
                                  18               Congress has expressed repeatedly, through Con-
