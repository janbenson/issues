<p/><h3>SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Monetary policy can only affect the level of employment in the short term because nonmonetary factors determine the level of employment in the long term. At best, the Federal Reserve may temporarily increase the level of employment through monetary policy, but such efforts risk the possibility of price inflation and increased business cycle volatility in the future. However, the Federal Reserve can achieve price stability in the long term through monetary policy. Price stability is desirable because both price inflation and price deflation damage the U.S. economy. Therefore, to maximize long-term economic growth and achieve the highest sustainable level of real output and employment, price stability should be the objective of monetary policy.</p><p>(2) Countries whose central bank has a single mandate for price stability generally have a better record of achieving stable prices than countries whose central bank has a mandate that gives equal weight to other objectives such as maximum employment or low interest rates.</p><p>(3) In general, an overly accommodative monetary policy inflates both asset prices and prices for goods and services. However, an overly accommodative monetary policy may sometimes cause a misallocation of capital that inflates asset prices disproportionately, creating unsustainable bubbles in asset prices, while price indices for goods and services do not register significant price inflation. When asset bubbles burst, many investments must be liquidated at considerable cost to the U.S. economy in terms of lower real output and employment.</p><p>(4) Price stability cannot always be measured solely through price indices for goods and services since such indices exclude changes in asset prices. Therefore, the Federal Reserve should monitor (A) the prices of, and the expected returns from, major asset classes (including equities, residential real estate, commercial and industrial real estate, agricultural real estate, gold and other commodities, corporate bonds, U.S. Government bonds, State and local government bonds, and other securities), (B) the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and (C) the value of the United States dollar relative to gold, as metrics to determine whether the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy is consistent with long-term price stability.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 102. PRICE STABILITY MANDATE.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) In General- Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 225a) is amended--</p><ul><p>(1) by striking &#8216;goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates&#8217; and inserting &#8216;goal of long-term price stability&#8217;;</p><p>(2) by striking &#8216;The Board of Governors&#8217; and inserting the following:</p></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;(a) In General- The Board of Governors&#8217;; and</p></blockquote><ul><p>(3) by adding at the end the following:</p></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;(b) Price Stability Metrics-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) IN GENERAL- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) define the term &#8216;long-term price stability&#8217; for purposes of subsection (a); and</p><p>&#8216;(B) establish metrics that the Board and the Committee will use to evaluate whether long-term price stability is being achieved.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(2) ESTABLISHMENT OF METRICS- In establishing the metrics described under paragraph (1)(B), the Board and Committee shall--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) take into consideration price indices of goods and services; and</p><p>&#8216;(B) evaluate, on an ongoing basis--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) whether such metrics are comprehensively reflecting price movements in the economy; and</p><p>&#8216;(ii) whether any price movements not captured by the price indices of goods and services are causing a significant misallocation of capital in the United States economy.</p></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(3) METRIC EVALUATION- The Board and Committee shall, with respect to the evaluation process required pursuant to paragraph (2)(B), monitor--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) the prices of, and the expected returns from, major asset classes (including equities, residential real estate, commercial and industrial real estate, agricultural real estate, commodities, corporate bonds, State and local government bonds, and other securities) and the allocation of capital in financial markets and the broader economy;</p><p>&#8216;(B) the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) the value of the United States dollar relative to gold.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(4) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE; REPORT TO THE CONGRESS- The Board and the Committee shall, with respect to the definition of long-term price stability and the establishment of metrics set pursuant to paragraph (1)--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) make such definition and metrics available to the public on a website maintained by the Board or the Committee; and</p><p>&#8216;(B) each time such definition and metrics are set or revised, issue a report to the Congress stating such definition and metrics.&#8217;.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p>(b) Additional Evaluations and Determinations Included in Semi-Annual Report to Congress- Section 2B(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 225b(b)) is amended--</p><ul><p>(1) by striking &#8216;containing a discussion&#8217; and inserting the following:</p></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;containing--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) a discussion&#8217;;</p><p>(2) by striking the period and inserting a semicolon; and</p><p>(3) by adding at the end the following:</p><p>&#8216;(2) the results of the evaluation process conducted pursuant to section 2A(b)(2)(B);</p><p>&#8216;(3) a determination of whether the goal of long-term price stability is being met and, if such goal is not being met, an explanation of why the goal is not being met and the steps that the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee will take to ensure that the goal is met in the future;</p><p>&#8216;(4) a description of the main monetary policy instruments used by the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee and a description of the strategy of the Board and the Committee with respect to using such instruments to achieve the goal of long-term price stability; and&#8217;.</p></ul></blockquote></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE II--FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MORAL HAZARD MITIGATION ACT</p></center></h4>
<p/><h3>SEC. 201. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) The Federal Reserve performs an essential function for financial stability by serving as lender of last resort in order to--</p><ul><p>(A) prevent the unnecessary failures of otherwise solvent United States banks and other financial institutions;</p><p>(B) reduce the likelihood of financial contagion and disruptions in United States financial markets; and</p><p>(C) minimize any adverse effects on real output and employment in the United States economy.</p></ul><p>(2) In acting as the lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve, may--</p><ul><p>(A) buy debt securities at fair market value; or</p><p>(B) provide short-term credit, secured by appropriate collateral in proper margin, to otherwise solvent banks and other financial institutions that encounter funding difficulties during a financial crisis.</p></ul><p>(3) Nevertheless, in its nearly 100-year history, the Federal Reserve has never clearly articulated its lender-of-last-resort policy.</p><p>(4) The absence of an official lender-of-last-resort policy has led to--</p><ul><p>(A) increased economic uncertainty because no one knows with certainty how the Federal Reserve may behave;</p><p>(B) financially distressed firms seeking political solutions in the form of pressure from Congress or the Administration being placed on the Federal Reserve to act to save them; and</p><p>(C) a moral hazard problem from financial institutions taking greater risks and increasing leverage based upon assumptions of how the Federal Reserve will act, though there is no formal statement assuring how the Federal Reserve will act.</p></ul><p>(5) By establishing a formal lender-of-last-resort policy, the Federal Reserve would decrease uncertainty in the market during times of financial crisis and mitigate the moral hazards created by recent bailouts.</p><p>(6) An official lender-of-last-resort policy should provide that once a financial crisis has dissipated, the Federal Reserve should, in an orderly way, sell any debt securities that--</p><ul><p>(A) the Federal Reserve acquired acting as lender of last resort; and</p><p>(B) the Federal Reserve does not normally own for its System Account.</p></ul><p>(7) Further, to reduce moral hazard, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s lender-of-last-resort policy should make clear that credit in any form will not be provided to insolvent banks or other financial institution.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 202. LENDER-OF-LAST-RESORT POLICY.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) In General- Not later than the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall clearly articulate the Board&#8217;s lender-of-last-resort policy.</p><p>(b) Consultation- In articulating the policy required under subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with--</p><ul><p>(1) the Federal Reserve bank presidents;</p><p>(2) the Comptroller of the Currency;</p><p>(3) the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;</p><p>(4) the Securities and Exchange Commission;</p><p>(5) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and</p><p>(6) such other persons with expertise in financial services regulation and monetary policy as the Board of Governors may determine appropriate.</p></ul></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE III--DIVERSIFYING THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE TO REFLECT A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY ACT</p></center></h4>
<p/><h3>SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) The Federal Reserve Act delineates specific requirements for the seven governors charged with oversight of the Federal Reserve System.</p><p>(2) In a reflection of the Federal Reserve System&#8217;s decentralized structure that broadly distributes power and responsibility across the Nation, the Act mandates that the presidentially appointed governors come from a wide range of geographic locations and professional backgrounds. Specifically, the first undesignated paragraph under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act states that &#8216;In selecting the members of the Board, not more than one of whom shall be selected from any one Federal Reserve District, the President shall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country.&#8217;.</p><p>(3) The Federal Open Monetary Committee consists of members of the Board of Governors and the President or Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on a permanent basis and rotates voting membership among the remaining Regional Reserve Banks.</p><p>(4) The existing structure of the Federal Open Market Committee places too much authority in the hands of Washington and New York at the expense of the remainder of the United States.</p><p>(5) Monetary policy should be conducted in the interest of all Americans and that policy goal is best achieved by a Federal Open Market Committee that provides greater representation and voice in policy decisions to the entire Nation as represented by the Regional Reserve Banks. This objective is best achieved by reforming the voting membership of the Federal Open Market Committee to include all Regional Reserve Banks on a permanent basis.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 302. FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP.</h3>
<ul><p>Section 12A(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 263(a)) is amended--</p><ul><p>(1) by striking &#8216;five representatives of the Federal Reserve banks to be selected as hereinafter provided.&#8217; and inserting &#8216;1 representative from each of the Federal Reserve banks.&#8217;; and</p><p>(2) by striking &#8216;and, beginning with the election for the term commencing March 1, 1943, shall be elected annually as follows: One by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond, one by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Chicago, one by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Dallas, and St. Louis, and one by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. In such elections each board of directors shall have one vote; and the details of such elections may be governed by regulations prescribed by the committee, which may be amended from time to time.&#8217; and inserting &#8216;and shall be elected by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve bank that they are to represent.&#8217;.</p></ul></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE IV--DEMYSTIFICATION OF MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS ACT</p></center></h4>
<p/><h3>SEC. 401. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) A more efficient release of transcripts from the Federal Reserve would result in better guidance for market participants, and hence more economically efficient decision making.</p><p>(2) According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, &#8216;when the monetary policy committee regularly provides information about objectives, economic outlook, and policy plans, two benefits result: (1) markets will price assets more efficiently, and (2) a closer alignment between market participants&#8217; expectations about the course of future short-term interest rates and&#8217; the views of policymakers.</p><p>(3) The Federal Reserve is able to release transcripts more efficiently without compromising their decision making process.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 402. RELEASE OF TRANSCRIPTS.</h3>
<ul><p>Section 12A(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 263(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p><blockquote><p>&#8216;(d) Release of Transcripts- The Committee shall release meeting transcripts to the public not later than the end of the 3-year period following each meeting.&#8217;.</p></blockquote></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE V--EXCHANGE RATE RESPONSIBILITY ACT</p></center></h4>
<p/><h3>SEC. 501. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p>(1) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee exercise control over the supply of U.S. dollars, which is a major factor affecting the foreign exchange rate value of the United States dollar. Therefore, the Board of Governors and Federal Open Market Committee should report to Congress on the impact of monetary policy on the foreign exchange rate value of the United States dollar.</p><p>(2) Over the last several decades, Secretaries of the Treasury have repeatedly used the Exchange Stabilization Fund for purposes that were not envisioned by Congress. To prevent further abuses, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should be renamed as the Special Drawing Rights Fund. The Special Drawing Rights Fund should hold the Special Drawing Rights that the International Monetary Fund provided to the United States. Any other assets currently in the Exchange Stabilization Fund should be liquidated, and the proceeds used to reduce the public debt.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 502. REPORT ON THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE POLICY.</h3>
<ul><p>Section 2B(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by section 102(b), is further amended by adding at the end the following:</p><blockquote><ul><p>&#8216;(5) an analysis of how the policies of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee are affecting the foreign exchange rate value of the United States dollar.&#8217;.</p></ul></blockquote></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 503.
