as victims of teen dating violence are at increased risk of mood and behavior problems as young adults, and at increased risk for future violent relationships;</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">Whereas girls victimized by a teen boyfriend reported more heavy drinking, smoking, depression, and thoughts of suicide, and teens of both sexes who were in aggressive relationships were 2 to 3 times more likely to be in violent relationships as young adults;</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more than twice as likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease;</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">Whereas according to the 2009 Parent/Teen Dating Violence Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., although 82 percent of parents are confident that they could recognize the signs if their child was experiencing dating abuse, 58 percent of parents could not correctly identify all of the warning signs of abuse;</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of teenage girls say that they have not had a conversation with a parent about dating abuse in the past year;</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say that they have been called names, harassed, or put down by their partner through telephones and texting;</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">Whereas according to the 2010 College Dating Violence and Abuse Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., 43 percent of college women who date report experiencing abusive dating behaviors;</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">Whereas 70 percent of college students who were in an abusive relationship failed to realize that they were in an abusive relationship, and 60 percent of such students said that no one stepped in to help them when they were in an abusive relationship;</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of violence was established in adolescence;</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of addressing teen dating violence, and many successful examples of such programs include education, community outreach, and social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">Whereas educating middle school students and their parents about the importance of building healthy relationships and preventing teen dating violence is key to deterring abuse before it begins;</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are necessary for youth victims and abusers;
