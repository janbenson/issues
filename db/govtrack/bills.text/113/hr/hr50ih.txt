                                       Expressing support for designation of February 4, 2013,
                                                as National Cancer Prevention Day.

                                  Whereas National Cancer Prevention Day is a day to remind
                                     us that when looking at cancer we need to look at preven-
                                     tion and reducing risks for human health and the envi-
                                     ronment;
                                  Whereas when we work to prevent cancer risks, it impacts
                                     human health, the environment, and the economy;
                                  Whereas cancer is one of the leading causes of death around
                                     the world and has touched the lives of nearly everyone,





                                     either directly or indirectly;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas the disease is the cause of nearly 1 out of every 4
                                     deaths in the United States;
                                  Whereas by the end of 2013, approximately 1,660,290 new
                                     cases are expected to be diagnosed across the United
                                     States;
                                  Whereas almost 1,600 cancer-related deaths per day are ex-
                                     pected throughout the year for a total of approximately
                                     580,350; and
                                  Whereas February 4, 2013, would be an appropriate date to
                                     designate as Cancer Prevention Day: Now, therefore, be

                                    5              for the reduction of cancer risks; and
                                    6                        (3) recognizes the devastating effect cancer has
                                    7              on families and wishes to expand knowledge, encour-
