                                  Whereas the first volunteer militia unit in America was
                                     formed in 1636 in Massachusetts Bay, followed by other
                                     units in the colonies of Virginia and Connecticut;

                                  Whereas the American militia answered the call during the
                                     second war with Britain in 1812;
                                  Whereas in the 19th century, during the Mexican-American
                                     War, the United States Civil War, and the Spanish-
                                     American War, State militia volunteers mustered when
                                     called and more than 300,000 gave their lives in service
                                     of the United States of America;
                                  Whereas in World War I, nearly all National Guardsmen
                                     were mobilized into Federal service, and while they rep-
                                     resented only 15 percent of the total United States Army,
                                     they comprised 40 percent of the American divisions sent
                                     to France and sustained 43 percent of the casualties in
                                     combat;
                                  Whereas in World War II, the National Guard comprised 19

                                  Whereas the National Defense Act of 1947 formed the Air
                                     National Guard, created a minimum of one flying unit in
                                     each State, with the result of more than 44,000 Air
                                     Guard troops serving in Korea and 4,000 Air Guard
                                     troops in Vietnam;

                                  Whereas 600,387 Air and Army National Guard soldiers and
                                     airmen have deployed in the many campaigns since 9/11;
                                  Whereas Air and Army National Guard soldiers and airmen
                                     have been involved in countless domestic response mis-
                                     sions, including missions in response to hurricanes, tor-
                                     nadoes, floods, and forest fires;
                                  Whereas during the Cold War, the National Guard was re-
                                     garded as a Strategic Reserve to be held in case of a So-
                                     viet invasion of Europe, yet, since 9/11, the National
                                     Guard and the Federal Reserves have made the transi-
                                     tion to an Operational Reserve, in constant use and rota-
                                     tion for missions at home and abroad;
                                  Whereas the Operational Reserve has time and again dem-
                                     onstrated its readiness to meet operational requirements,
                                     and its mission- and cost-effectiveness and volunteerism
                                     are the heart of modern United States military service;
                                     and
                                  Whereas the Operational Reserve must be sustained by a
                                     fully manned and fully funded National Guard in the
                                     spirit intended by the Framers and enshrined in article
