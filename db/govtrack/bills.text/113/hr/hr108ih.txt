                                  113TH CONGRESS

                                  Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright,
                                      in which the Supreme Court held that counsel must be provided to
                                      indigent defendants in all felony cases.




                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                              MARCH 12, 2013
                                  Mr. DEUTCH (for himself, Mr. CHABOT, Mr. NADLER, Mr. CONYERS, and Mr.
                                      WATT) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the
                                      Committee on the Judiciary




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the landmark case Gid-
                                     eon v. Wainwright, in which the Supreme Court held
                                     that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants
                                     in all felony cases.

                                  Whereas, on March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court recognized
                                     in Gideon v. Wainwright that counsel must be provided
                                     to indigent defendants in all felony cases;
                                  Whereas the Supreme Court held that providing counsel to
                                     indigent defendants in all felony cases meets the essential
                                     requirements of the 6th amendment to the United States
                                     Constitution;





                                  Whereas the Supreme Court held in Argersinger v. Hamlin
                                     that indigent defendants are entitled, under the 6th



                                                                                             2
                                          amendment to the United States Constitution, to court-
                                          appointed counsel in all cases where imprisonment is a
                                          possibility;
                                  Whereas 50 years after the Gideon v. Wainwright decision,
                                     excessive caseloads are preventing counsel for indigent
                                     defendants from providing quality representation; and
                                  Whereas the provision of counsel to indigent defendants often
                                     lacks fairness and increases the risk that poor people will
                                     be wrongfully convicted: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
                                    2                        (1) recognizes and honors the 50th anniversary
                                    3              of the decision in Gideon v. Wainwright;
                                    4                        (2) encourages all people in the United States
                                    5              to recognize and honor the 50th anniversary of the
                                    6              Gideon v. Wainwright decision; and
                                    7                        (3) supports strategies to improve the criminal
                                    8              justice system to ensure that indigent defendants in
                                    9              all felony cases are adequately represented by coun-
