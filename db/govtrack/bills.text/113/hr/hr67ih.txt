                                   Mrs. CHRISTENSEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to

                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the need to raise awareness and promote capacity
                                     building to strategically address the lionfish invasion in
                                     the Atlantic Ocean.

                                  Whereas two species of venomous lionfish, the red lionfish
                                     (Pterois volitans) and devil firefish (Pterois miles), were
                                     likely introduced into the Atlantic Ocean via the United
                                     States aquarium trade in the 1980s;
                                  Whereas lionfish are now established throughout the coastal
                                     southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and many re-
                                     gions of the Gulf of Mexico;
                                  Whereas lionfish may live for decades in high densities and
                                     reproduce at an alarming rate by spawning over





                                     2,000,000 eggs per year per female;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas lionfish inhabit most coastal marine reef habitats up
                                     to 1,000 feet deep;
                                  Whereas in the Atlantic Ocean, lionfish consume over 50 spe-
                                     cies of fish, some of which are commercially,
                                     recreationally, and ecologically important;
                                  Whereas lionfish may impact species of concern such as the
                                     Nassau grouper and Warsaw grouper, speckled hind,
                                     striped croaker, and key silverside;
                                  Whereas the economic impacts of lionfish may include hin-
                                     dering stock rebuilding efforts for commercially and
                                     recreationally important species;
                                  Whereas economic losses for fishermen from lionfish may in-
                                     clude loss of fishing days when painful envenomation oc-
                                     curs and reduced catches of some commercial species;
                                  Whereas predation on herbivores by lionfish can result in cas-
                                     cading impacts such as increased macroalgae and de-
                                     creased coral biomass which would threaten ecosystem in-
                                     tegrity and ecosystem services provided by coral reef eco-
                                     systems;
                                  Whereas lionfish may impact Atlantic Ocean biodiversity by
                                     consuming fish species critical to maintaining healthy
                                     and viable coral reef and hard-bottom ecosystems;
                                  Whereas interactions with other reef stressors such as ocean
                                     acidification, warming temperatures, and other factors
                                     could exacerbate lionfish impacts;
                                  Whereas the destruction of coral reefs and increased human
                                     health hazards from lionfish may have devastating im-
                                     pacts on the tourism industry, which is critical to the





                                     economies of coastal communities;

                                  Whereas current technology suggests lionfish eradication at
                                     the regional scale is likely not feasible given the expansive
                                     depths and geography of lionfish habitat;
                                  Whereas control plans that support sustained removals of
                                     lionfish can significantly reduce local lionfish densities;
                                     and
