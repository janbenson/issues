Wainwright that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases;</p><p>Whereas the Supreme Court held that providing counsel to indigent defendants in all felony cases meets the essential requirements of the 6th amendment to the United States Constitution;</p><p>Whereas the Supreme Court held in Argersinger v. Hamlin that indigent defendants are entitled, under the 6th amendment to the United States Constitution, to court-appointed counsel in all cases where imprisonment is a possibility;</p><p>Whereas 50 years after the Gideon v. Wainwright decision, excessive caseloads are preventing counsel for indigent defendants from providing quality representation; and</p><p>Whereas the provision of counsel to indigent defendants often lacks fairness and increases the risk that poor people will be wrongfully convicted: Now, therefore, be it</p><ul><p><em>  Resolved,</em> That the House of Representatives--</p><ul><p>(1) recognizes and honors the 50th anniversary of the decision in Gideon v. Wainwright;</p><p>(2) encourages all people in the United States to recognize and honor the 50th anniversary of the Gideon v.
