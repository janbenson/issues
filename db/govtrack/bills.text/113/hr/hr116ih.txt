                                  Expressing support for the designation of March 13 as ‘‘K–
                                     9 Veterans Day’’, in order to recognize the service and
                                     improve the treatment of military working dogs.

                                  Whereas, on March 13, 1942, the Quartermaster Corps of
                                     the United States Army began training dogs for a newly
                                     established War Dog Program, or K–9 Corps;
                                  Whereas military working dogs and their handlers have
                                     served the United States since World War I in roles such
                                     as sentry duty, search and rescue, detection of explosives
                                     and narcotics, border protection, and other military and
                                     law enforcement duties;





                                  Whereas, in 1921, General John Pershing awarded a gold
                                     medal to ‘‘Sgt. Stubby’’, a military working dog, and the



                                                                                             2
                                          dog visited the White House in 1921 to meet President
                                          Harding and in 1924 to meet President Coolidge;
                                  Whereas ‘‘Chips’’, a German Shepherd-Collie-Siberian Husky
                                     who valiantly served with the Third Infantry Division
                                     during World War II, was awarded the Distinguished
                                     Service Cross, Silver Star, and Purple Heart for taking
                                     actions that saved lives in his unit;
                                  Whereas ‘‘Chips’ ’’ awards were revoked due to Army policy;
                                  Whereas over 10,000 military working dogs were trained at
                                     War Dog Centers during World War II;
                                  Whereas Federal, State, and municipal law enforcement
                                     agencies utilize working dogs to achieve their missions
                                     and protect our communities;
                                  Whereas K–9 veterans have saved countless lives at home
                                     and abroad in service to United States military and law
                                     enforcement agencies;
                                  Whereas, today, over 2,300 military working dogs are de-
                                     ployed worldwide in support of the Global War on Ter-
                                     rorism;
                                  Whereas the United States has increasingly relied on military
                                     working dogs due to their unique skills and capabilities;
                                     and
                                  Whereas retired military working dogs have successfully
                                     transitioned to roles as pets and therapy dogs: Now,
                                     therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
