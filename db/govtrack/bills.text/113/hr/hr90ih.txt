                                      program (SNAP) in effect under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008,
                                      and that the House of Representatives should reject any proposed legisla-

                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     the Committee on Agriculture should not propose any
                                     reduction in the availability or amount of benefits pro-

                                     should reject any proposed legislation that includes any
                                     provisions that reduce the availability or amount of bene-
                                     fits provided under SNAP.

                                  Whereas food insecurity means that people face an ongoing
                                     struggle against hunger;
                                  Whereas 50.1 million people lived in food insecure households
                                     in 2011;
                                  Whereas the supplemental nutrition assistance program
                                     (SNAP), established in the Food and Nutrition Act of
                                     2008, is the nation’s first line of defense against hunger
                                     and food insecurity;
                                  Whereas SNAP served more than 47.5 million individuals in
                                     October 2012;
                                  Whereas half of all new SNAP participants receive benefits
                                     for 10 months or less and 74 percent of such participants
                                     left the program entirely within 2 years;
                                  Whereas the average SNAP household has income slightly
                                     less than 59 percent of the applicable poverty level, and
                                     83 percent of all benefits go to households with a child,
                                     elderly individual, or disabled individual;
                                  Whereas the SNAP benefits average less than $1.50 per indi-
                                     vidual per meal;
                                  Whereas 83 percent of families on SNAP make less than
                                     $24,000 a year for a family of 4;
                                  Whereas the average SNAP benefit per household is approxi-

                                  Whereas SNAP participation rises when the economy is
                                     weak;





                                  Whereas millions of Americans need to turn to SNAP as a
                                     way to feed themselves and their families;

                                  Whereas SNAP would have lifted 3.9 million Americans, in-
                                     cluding 1.7 million children, out of poverty in 2011 if its
                                     benefits were included in the official measures of income
                                     and poverty;
                                  Whereas SNAP is an efficient public-private partnership that
                                     runs on the regular channels of commerce—regular retail

                                  Whereas SNAP achieved the highest level of overall payment
                                     accuracy in the history of the program at 96.2 percent;
                                  Whereas the national overpayment error rate, defined as the
                                     percentage of SNAP benefit dollars issued in excess of
                                     the amounts for which households are eligible, fell to 2.99
                                     percent;
                                  Whereas the national underpayment error rate, defined as the

                                     than the amounts for which households are eligible, was
                                     less than 1.0 percent;
                                  Whereas every dollar in new SNAP benefits generates up to
                                     $1.79 in economic activity;
                                  Whereas each $1 billion increase in SNAP benefits is esti-
                                     mated to create or maintain 18,000 full-time equivalent
                                     jobs, including 3,000 farm jobs;
                                  Whereas in the 112th Congress, the Committee on Agri-
                                     culture of the House of Representatives reported H.R.

                                     that H.R. 6083 as reported would cut SNAP by $16.5
                                     billion over 10 years;

                                     streamlined procedures that cut down on red tape and

                                     would be caused by cuts in SNAP of the kinds provided
                                     in H.R. 6083 as reported in the 112th Congress by the
