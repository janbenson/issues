Whereas, on February 12, 2013, North Korea exploded a nu-

Whereas reports indicate that the nuclear test was apparently
   more powerful than North Korea’s previous tests in 2006
   and 2009;
Whereas North Korea’s nuclear test, and its recent ballistic
   missile test, are violations of United Nations Security
   Council Resolution 1695 (2006), Resolution 1718 (2006),
   Resolution 1874 (2009), and Resolution 2087 (2013);
Whereas North Korea’s ballistic missile program poses a
   threat to United States allies and interests in the Asia
   Pacific region;
Whereas North Korea’s ballistic missile program has dem-
   onstrated an increasing ability to reach the United
   States, and could constitute a grave threat to the security
   of the American people;
Whereas North Korea has violated the July 27, 1953, Armi-
   stice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and has
   since committed unprovoked acts of war against South
   Korea by sinking the warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her
   crew, and by attacking civilian targets on the island of
                              2
    Yeongpyeong, killing four residents, among many other
    willful violations and outrages;
Whereas the Government of North Korea has been implicated
   repeatedly in the illicit laundering of monetary instru-
   ments, in international narcotics trafficking, and in the
   counterfeiting of United States currency and intellectual
   property;
Whereas North Korea has demonstrated a willingness and
   ability to proliferate its ballistic and nuclear technology
   to a variety of countries, including Iran and Syria, both
   United States designated state sponsors of terrorism;
Whereas the Government of North Korea commits gross
   human rights violations against the North Korean people,
   including maintaining a system of gulags that imprison
   thousands of citizens, and policies that have resulted in
   starvation deaths of over 2,000,000 people; and
Whereas the Government of North Korea has repeatedly vio-
   lated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, and ir-
   reversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons program,
   including the Agreed Framework of 1994, the Joint
   Statement of September 19, 2005, and the agreement of
   February 13, 2007: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
         (1) condemns the Government of North Korea for
    its flagrant and repeated violations of multiple United

    device;

North Korea’s closest ally and trading partner, to pres-
sure North Korean leaders to curtail their provocative
behavior, abandon and dismantle their nuclear and mis-

ernment of North Korea, and comply with all relevant
international agreements and United Nations Security

tions;
     (5) calls on the People’s Republic of China to take

sile programs; and
     (6) calls on the United States Government—

          (A) to apply all available sanctions on North
     Korea, cooperate with United States allies and

     North Korea, and secure a new United Nations Se-
     curity Council resolution imposing stronger sanc-
     tions;
          (B) to utilize aggressively the range of avail-
     able legal authorities and resources to defend
     United States interests against North Korean illicit
     activities; and
          (C) to support the President’s commitment to
     strengthen the United States ballistic missile de-
     fense system to protect the United States.
