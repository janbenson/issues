                                  Whereas Dr. Shakil Afridi is a hero to whom the people of
                                     the United States owe a debt of gratitude for his help in
                                     finding the hiding place of Osama bin Laden;
                                  Whereas Dr. Afridi, a Pakistani physician, demonstrated the
                                     universally respected attributes of courage, dignity, and
                                     honor in aiding the United States in bringing to an end
                                     the reign of the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden who





                                     masterminded the September 11, 2001, attacks which
                                     murdered 3,000 United States citizens; and

                                  Whereas Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Govern-
                                     ment of Pakistan, a deplorable situation which con-
                                     stitutes a hostile act by Pakistan against the United
                                     States and belies the notion that Pakistan is an ally in
                                     the war against terrorism: Now, therefore, be it

                                    3 and that he should be immediately released from custody
