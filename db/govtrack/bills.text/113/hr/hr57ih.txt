                                                                         FEBRUARY 6, 2013
                                       Mr. LATTA           submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the
                                                                Committee on Energy and Commerce




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     in order to continue aggressive growth in the Nation’s
                                     telecommunications and technology industries, the United
                                     States Government should ‘‘Get Out of the Way and
                                     Stay Out of the Way’’.

                                  Whereas the technology and communications industries in the
                                     United States have historically been some of the most
                                     competitive in the world and devoid of burdensome Gov-
                                     ernment regulations;
                                  Whereas the United States has over 85,000,000 wireline
                                     broadband connections;





                                  Whereas wireless auctions are the reason the United States
                                     has over 235,000,000 wireless broadband connections;



                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas public-private partnerships, like those piloted by or-
                                     ganizations such as Connected Nation, have raised
                                     broadband subscription rates, especially in rural areas, by
                                     increasing both broadband supply and demand without
                                     having to rely on regulation;
                                  Whereas deregulatory policies and free-market competition
                                     consistently yield a higher rate of economic growth, a
                                     greater standard of living for all Americans, and an en-
                                     hanced capacity for the United States to be competitive
                                     in the global marketplace;
                                  Whereas the digital age not only expands an individual’s
                                     reach and ability to connect with family and friends, pro-
                                     vides new and exciting educational opportunities, and ex-
                                     pands a growing global economy, while simultaneously ex-
                                     posing an individual to a myriad of new threats such as
                                     identity theft and other methods of online victimization,
                                     and resulting in the increase of attempted criminal cyber
                                     attacks on businesses and communications networks; and
                                  Whereas we should continually strive to advance this rapidly
                                     growing source of social and economic benefit to the Na-
