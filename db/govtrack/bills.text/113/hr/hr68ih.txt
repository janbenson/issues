                                   Mrs. CHRISTENSEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to

                                                              RESOLUTION
                                        Expressing support for the goals and ideals of National
                                                       Marine Awareness Day.

                                  Whereas the ocean covers 71 percent of the Earth’s surface
                                     and contains 97 percent of the planet’s water;
                                  Whereas the marine environment supports the life of nearly
                                     50 percent of all species on Earth and helps sustain that
                                     life by providing 20 percent of the animal protein and
                                     five percent of the total protein in the human diet;
                                  Whereas coastal habitats account for approximately 1⁄3 of all
                                     marine biological productivity, estuarine ecosystems are
                                     among the most productive regions on the planet, and
                                     coral reefs shelter the highest levels of marine diversity





                                     in the world;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas coral reef ecosystems are a source of food for mil-

                                     sion; provide habitat and spawning and nursery grounds
                                     for economically important fish species; provide jobs and
                                     income to local economies from fishing, recreation, and
                                     tourism; are a source of new medicines; and are hotspots
                                     of marine biodiversity;
                                  Whereas it is difficult to put a dollar value on some of the
                                     benefits the world’s marine ecosystems provide, but a re-

                                  Whereas one of every six jobs in the United States is marine-
                                     related and over one-third of the United States gross na-
                                     tional product originates in coastal areas;
                                  Whereas 80 percent of the United States Virgin Islands’
                                     gross domestic product and employment are based on
                                     marine-related tourism;
                                  Whereas the economy and cultural heritage of American

                                     lands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and coastal states across the
                                     continental United States are significantly reliant on the
                                     tremendous ecosystem services that the ocean provides;
                                  Whereas human-dominated marine ecosystems are experi-
                                     encing accelerating loss of populations and species with
                                     largely unknown consequences, overall rates of resource
                                     collapse have increased, and recovery potential, stability,
                                     and water quality have decreased exponentially with de-
                                     clining diversity;





                                  Whereas the ocean has absorbed a significant portion of all
                                     carbon dioxide emissions, causing unprecedented changes

                                  Whereas large quantities of human-generated trash enters
                                     the marine environment as marine debris and causes a
                                     decrease in water quality, death and morbidity for marine
                                     mammals, depletion of valuable fisheries, and decreased

                                     radation of water quality, harmful fishing practices, and
                                     a changing climate are adversely affecting our precious
                                     marine resources;
                                  Whereas coral reefs, seabirds, marine mammals, fisheries,
                                     and tourism will be severely impacted by the Deepwater
                                     Horizon oil spill;
                                  Whereas marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the
                                     ocean’s capacity to function effectively as a system, or to
                                     provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from
                                     perturbations, yet available data suggest that at this
                                     point these trends are still reversible and the restoration
                                     of marine ecosystem biodiversity has shown to increase
                                     system productivity by fourfold;

                                     environment, as demonstrated through the passage and
