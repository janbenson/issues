                                     more powerful than North Korea’s previous tests in 2006
                                     and 2009;
                                  Whereas North Korea’s nuclear test, and its recent ballistic

                                     onstrated an increasing ability to reach the United
                                     States, and could constitute a grave threat to the security
                                     of the American people;
                                  Whereas North Korea has violated the July 10, 1953, Armi-
                                     stice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and has
                                     since committed unprovoked acts of war against South
                                     Korea by sinking the warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her
                                     crew, and by attacking civilian targets on the island of
                                     Yeongpyeong, killing four residents, among many other
                                     willful violations and outrages;
                                  Whereas the Government of North Korea has been implicated
                                     repeatedly in the illicit laundering of monetary instru-
                                     ments, in international narcotics trafficking, and in the
                                     counterfeiting of United States currency and intellectual
                                     property;
                                  Whereas North Korea has demonstrated a willingness and
                                     ability to proliferate its ballistic and nuclear technology
                                     to a variety of countries, including Iran and Syria, both
                                     United States designated state sponsors of terrorism;
                                  Whereas the Government of North Korea commits gross
