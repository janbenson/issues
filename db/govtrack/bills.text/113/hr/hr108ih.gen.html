<p nid="t0:ih:11">Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright, in which the Supreme Court held that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases.</p><p nid="t0:ih:12">Whereas, on March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court recognized in Gideon v.

Hamlin that indigent defendants are entitled, under the 6th amendment to the United States Constitution, to court-appointed counsel in all cases where imprisonment is a possibility;</p><p nid="t0:ih:15">Whereas 50 years after the Gideon v. Wainwright decision, excessive caseloads are preventing counsel for indigent defendants from providing quality representation; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:16">Whereas the provision of counsel to indigent defendants often lacks fairness and increases the risk that poor people will be wrongfully convicted: Now, therefore, be it</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17"><em>  Resolved,</em> That the House of Representatives--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:18">(1) recognizes and honors the 50th anniversary of the decision in Gideon v.
