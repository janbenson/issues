                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                           FEBRUARY 26, 2013
                                  Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Ms. MATSUI, Ms. ESHOO, Ms. HAHN, Ms.

                                      MCGOVERN) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the
                                      Committee on Energy and Commerce




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                   Supporting the designation of National Digital Literacy Day.

                                  Whereas Congress has long recognized the need to close the
                                     digital divide for Americans of all ages;
                                  Whereas the Telecommunications Act of 1996 spurred a sig-
                                     nificant increase in broadband access in the United
                                     States, with only 15 percent of Americans having
                                     broadband access deployed to their homes before enact-
                                     ment and 98 percent of Americans having access to ei-
                                     ther fixed or mobile broadband today;
                                  Whereas this dedication to closing the digital divide has con-
                                     tinued through the evolution of programs such as the





                                     universal service Schools and Libraries Program (com-
                                     monly known as ‘‘E-rate’’), which has provided funding
                                     of more than $30 billion over the past 13 years and


                                                                                             2
                                          helped ensure that almost every school and library across
                                          the United States has Internet access;
                                  Whereas this dedication was further demonstrated through
                                     the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
                                     which called for the creation of the National Broadband
                                     Plan;
                                  Whereas the National Broadband Plan set a goal of having
                                     a 90-percent broadband adoption rate by 2020;
                                  Whereas these and other programs have strived to create a
                                     more productive, creative, and efficient Nation, where af-
                                     fordable broadband Internet is available everywhere and
                                     everyone has the means and skills to use valuable
                                     broadband applications;
                                  Whereas the United States has taken enormous strides dur-
                                     ing the last two decades in moving from analog to digital
                                     communications technologies and from limited access to
                                     near-universal access to mobile broadband, but more
                                     work remains to be done;
                                  Whereas it is estimated that 100 million Americans have not
                                     adopted broadband Internet in the home and one in five
                                     adults have no digital literacy skills;
                                  Whereas having no digital literacy skills means that a person
                                     does not possess the knowledge of how to operate a com-
                                     puter or use the Internet;
                                  Whereas Americans who do not use the Internet are missing
                                     out on opportunities to further their education, to access
                                     innovative health care services, and to find and qualify
                                     for a job;





                                  Whereas more than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies
                                     now require online job applications;

                                                                                             3
                                  Whereas the impact is particularly great in urban, low-in-
                                     come, minority, and rural areas, and less than one-third
                                     of the poorest Americans have adopted broadband;
                                  Whereas there is growing evidence of a ‘‘skills mismatch’’,
                                     which leaves unfilled many jobs that require basic digital
                                     skills, such as knowing how to use a computer, perform
                                     an electronic search, and upload or process a transaction;
                                  Whereas without increased training in these skills, this prob-
                                     lem is likely to worsen in the future, with nearly 80 per-
                                     cent of jobs in the next decade projected to require dig-
                                     ital skills;
                                  Whereas the digital divide keeps teachers from assigning
                                     Internet-based homework if a significant percentage of
                                     their students do not have broadband access at home,
                                     and teaching to the lowest digital denominator does not
                                     work for our children or our country;
                                  Whereas digital literacy is essential for education and pre-
                                     paring our children for the economy of the future, but
                                     when roughly one-third of American children do not use
                                     the Internet at home, all children are impacted;
                                  Whereas National Digital Literacy Day is a purely volunteer
                                     event during which Americans can focus on increasing
                                     awareness of what the Internet has to offer by helping
                                     others overcome their concerns and fears about getting
                                     online through emphasizing how the Internet is person-
                                     ally relevant to their lives;
                                  Whereas leaders in the public and private sectors have
                                     worked together and should continue to collaborate and
                                     partner to bring the benefits of the Internet to Americans





                                     of all ages; and

                                  Whereas March 21 would be an appropriate day to designate
                                     as National Digital Literacy Day: Now, therefore, be it
