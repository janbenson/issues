                                               Hurriya, and for other purposes.

                                  Whereas on February 9, 2013, dozens of rockets were fired
                                     on Camp Hurriya (formerly known as Camp Liberty) in
                                     Iraq where approximately 3,100 members of the Iranian
                                     opposition movement, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK),
                                     have been residing since being relocated from Camp
                                     Ashraf in February 2012;
                                  Whereas 7 unarmed residents were killed and approximately
                                     100 more wounded, some suffering severe and debili-





                                     tating injuries;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas The New York Times reported that Hezbollah Bri-
                                     gades, an Iranian-affiliated group, claimed responsibility
                                     for the attack and ‘‘warned that others would follow’’;
                                  Whereas in an interview with the Associated Press on Feb-
                                     ruary 26, 2013, one of the leaders of the Hezbollah Bri-
                                     gades, Wathiq al-Batat, claimed his group receives weap-
                                     ons and other support from Iran and promised more at-
                                     tacks to come, saying ‘‘We will strike them again until
                                     they leave’’;
                                  Whereas the United States Department of State condemned
                                     ‘‘in the strongest terms the vicious and senseless terrorist
                                     attack’’ on Camp Hurriya and demanded that, ‘‘the ter-
                                     rorists responsible for this attack must be brought to jus-
                                     tice’’;
                                  Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General strongly con-
                                     demned the attack and called for the perpetrators to be
                                     brought to justice;
                                  Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
                                     gees described the attack as ‘‘a despicable act of vio-
                                     lence’’;
                                  Whereas Amnesty International called the attack a ‘‘des-
                                     picable crime’’, and urged authorities in Iraq to ‘‘ensure
                                     not only that those responsible for this attack are
                                     brought to justice but that those living in the camp are
                                     protected’’;
                                  Whereas on December 25, 2011, then-Secretary of State Hil-
                                     lary Rodham Clinton announced the signing of a Memo-
                                     randum of Understanding between the Government of
                                     Iraq and the United Nations which outlined, ‘‘steps nec-

                                          residents of Ashraf, including their temporary relocation
                                          [from Camp Ashraf] to Camp Hurriya’’;
                                  Whereas on February 18, 2012, the United States Depart-
                                     ment of State commended the MEK members for their
                                     cooperation and assistance in implementation of the
                                     Memorandum of Understanding and pledged that, ‘‘In
                                     addition to around-the-clock U.N. human rights moni-
                                     toring, the U.S. will visit the temporary transit facility at
                                     [Hurriya] regularly and frequently’’;
                                  Whereas since the relocation to Camp Hurriya, only 6 resi-
                                     dents have been resettled through the United Nations
                                     process, despite the completion of over 1,800 interviews;
                                  Whereas Camp Hurriya asylum-seekers live in exposed trail-
                                     ers without the ability to protect themselves from future
                                     attacks; and
                                  Whereas the attack and the stated threat of future assaults
                                     lay bare the fact that these Iranian dissidents will neither
                                     be safe nor secure at Camp Hurriya which was des-
                                     ignated as a ‘‘temporary’’ place: Now, therefore, be it
