                                  Ms. LEE of California (for herself, Mr. BURGESS, and Mr. VAN HOLLEN) sub-
                                      mitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on
                                      Energy and Commerce




                                                               RESOLUTION
                                              Supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis
                                                               Awareness Week.

                                  Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact men and women of all
                                     ages, races, and ethnicities;
                                  Whereas approximately 2,100,000 people worldwide have
                                     been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis;
                                  Whereas multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed between the
                                     ages of 20 and 50, however it is estimated that between
                                     8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents are living
                                     with multiple sclerosis;
                                  Whereas multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological
                                     disease that interrupts the flow of information within the





                                     brain and between the brain and the rest of the body;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis range from numb-
                                     ness and tingling to blindness and paralysis and the
                                     progress, severity and specific symptoms of multiple scle-
                                     rosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;
                                  Whereas there is no laboratory test available that definitely
                                     defines a diagnosis for multiple sclerosis;
                                  Whereas multiple sclerosis is not directly inherited, but stud-
                                     ies show there are genetic factors that indicate certain in-
                                     dividuals are susceptible to the disease;
                                  Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown
                                     and there is no cure;
                                  Whereas in rare cases multiple sclerosis is so progressive it
                                     is fatal, but most people with multiple sclerosis have a
                                     normal or near-normal life expectancy;
                                  Whereas severe multiple sclerosis can shorten life;
                                  Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, an affiliation of
                                     multiple sclerosis organizations dedicated to the enhance-
                                     ment of the quality of life for all those affected by mul-
                                     tiple sclerosis, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis
                                     Awareness Week during March of every calendar year;
                                  Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition’s mission is to in-
                                     crease opportunities for cooperation and provide greater
                                     opportunity to leverage the effective use of resources for
                                     the benefit of the multiple sclerosis community;
                                  Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are
                                     to invite people to join the movement to end multiple
                                     sclerosis, encourage everyone to do something to dem-

                                     of multiple sclerosis, and to acknowledge those who have
                                     dedicated their time and talent to help promote multiple
                                     sclerosis research and programs; and

                                  Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is rec-
