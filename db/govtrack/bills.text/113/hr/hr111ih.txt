                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     the President should refrain from any further taxpayer-
                                     funded vacations until the White House can be re-opened
                                     for public tours.

                                  Whereas the Obama Administration announced on Tuesday
                                     March 5, 2013, that it would cancel all White House
                                     tours due to sequestration;
                                  Whereas the annual cost to the Secret Service of maintaining
                                     the White House open for public tours is approximately
                                     $3.7 million;





                                  Whereas the President has taken four trips to Hawaii in the
                                     past four years, at a cost to the taxpayers of at least $4


                                                                                             2
                                          million each, as well as numerous other vacations at
                                          enormous taxpayer expense;
                                  Whereas the President has plans for additional vacations in
                                     the coming months;
                                  Whereas the President has the complete discretion to transfer
                                     funds in such a way as to keep the White House open
                                     for tours; and
                                  Whereas Congress, under similar budgetary pressures, has
                                     maintained the Capitol open for public tours: Now, there-
                                    1fore, be it   Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
                                    2 resentatives that the President should refrain from any
                                    3 further vacations at the taxpayers’ expense until such
                                    4 sums have been saved that the people’s White House can
                                    5 be re-opened for public tours.
