                                        Supporting the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/
                                                        AIDS Awareness Day.

                                  Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                                     (CDC) estimates that in the United States, more than
                                     1,100,000 people are living with HIV, and 21 percent do





                                     not know they are infected;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas in 2010, approximately 47,129 people were diag-
                                     nosed with HIV in the United States, about 1 person in-
                                     fected with HIV every 11 minutes;
                                  Whereas African-Americans represented 44 percent of all
                                     people living with HIV in the United States in 2009;
                                  Whereas in 2010, nearly 21,000 African-Americans were di-
                                     agnosed with HIV/AIDS, contracting HIV at a rate 7.9
                                     times as high as the rate in Whites;
                                  Whereas although African-American teenagers (ages 13 to
                                     19) represent only 15 percent of all teenagers in the
                                     United States, they accounted for 69 percent of new HIV
                                     cases reported among teenagers in 2010;
                                  Whereas new HIV infections among African-American men
                                     who have sex with men (MSM) ages 13 to 29, increased
                                     48 percent from 2006 through 2009;
                                  Whereas young gay men of color bear a disproportionate bur-
                                     den of the epidemic, with the majority of new HIV infec-
                                     tions in 2010 occurring among 13- to 24-year-old Afri-
                                     can-American MSM, accounting for 45 percent of new in-
                                     fections among African-American MSM and 55 percent
                                     of all new infections among young MSM;
                                  Whereas in 2010, African-American women accounted for 68
                                     percent of new HIV infections among women and had an
                                     infection rate that was 20 times higher than that of
                                     White women;
                                  Whereas among African-American men, the leading trans-
                                     mission category of HIV infection in 2010 was sexual
                                     contact with other men, followed by heterosexual contact





                                     and intravenous drug use;
                                  Whereas in 2008, HIV/AIDS prevalence among men in pris-
                                     ons was 1.4 percent;

                                  Whereas in 2010, African-American males were imprisoned
                                     at a rate nearly 7 times that of White males;
                                  Whereas among African-American women, the leading trans-
                                     mission category of HIV infection is heterosexual contact,
                                     followed by intravenous drug use;
                                  Whereas the CDC notes that socioeconomic issues impact the
                                     rates of HIV infection among African-Americans, and
                                     studies have found an association between higher AIDS
                                     rates and lower incomes;
                                  Whereas African-Americans are diagnosed with AIDS later
                                     than their nonminority counterparts, are confronted with
                                     barriers in accessing care and treatment, and face higher
                                     morbidity and mortality outcomes;
                                  Whereas the CDC estimates that among persons whose diag-
                                     nosis of AIDS had been made during 1997 to 2004, Afri-
                                     can-Americans had the poorest survival rates of any ra-
                                     cial or ethnic group, with 66 percent surviving after 9
                                     years compared with 67 percent of American Indians and
                                     Alaska Natives, 74 percent of Hispanics, 75 percent of
                                     Whites, and 81 percent of Asians and Pacific Islanders;
                                  Whereas approximately 619,400 people have died of AIDS in
                                     the United States from the beginning of the HIV/AIDS
                                     epidemic through 2012, and African-Americans account
                                     for approximately 40 percent of such deaths;
                                  Whereas in 2007, HIV was the ninth leading cause of death
                                     for all African-Americans, and the third leading cause of
                                     death for both African-American men and African-Amer-
                                     ican women between the ages of 35 to 44;





                                  Whereas life-saving treatment is also proven prevention, and
                                     research shows that antiretroviral drugs can reduce the
                                     risk of transmitting HIV/AIDS by up to 96 percent;

                                  Whereas the Food and Drug Administration has approved
                                     pre-exposure prophylaxis as prevention for people who are
                                     HIV-negative;
                                  Whereas a sequester that triggers a 5.2-percent reduction
                                     across nondefense spending, as part of the Budget Con-
                                     trol Act, would result in harmful cuts to programs that
                                     would significantly undermine the domestic HIV/AIDS
                                     response;
                                  Whereas according to amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Re-
                                     search, and the National Minority AIDS Council
                                     (NMAC), such cuts to domestic HIV/AIDS services and
                                     research would result in the loss of HIV/AIDS treatment
                                     for 6,500 people of color in the AIDS Drug Assistance
                                     Program, as well as housing assistance for 1,850 house-
                                     holds, and delay the development of life-saving treatment,
                                     vaccines, and behavioral interventions;
                                  Whereas in 1998, Congress and the Clinton Administration
                                     created the National Minority AIDS Initiative to help co-
                                     ordinate funding, build capacity, and provide prevention,
                                     care, and treatment services within the African-American,

                                  Whereas the National Minority AIDS Initiative assists with
