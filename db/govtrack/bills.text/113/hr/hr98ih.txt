                                  Expressing support for Israel and its right to self-defense
                                     against the illegal nuclear program by the Islamic Repub-

                                  Whereas under customary international law, as well as Article

                                     Arabia, Iraq, and many others, leading to the serious
                                     threat of massive nuclear proliferation in the region, in
                                     violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nu-

                                     (Israel) off the map’’, in violation of Article 2, paragraph
                                     4 of the United Nations Charter;

                                     issued a report exposing Iran’s nuclear intentions and in
                                     November 2011 concluded that ‘‘contrary to the relevant

                                          weapons of mass destruction, and United States and
                                          international sanctions have not accomplished enough to
                                          deter its progress;
                                  Whereas Iran has actively engaged in ongoing armed hos-
                                     tilities against Israel for decades by supporting terrorism
                                     against Israel through military proxies, including the ter-

                                     have attacked Israeli civilians as well as military per-

                                     personnel in Argentina, Georgia, India, and Thailand;
                                  Whereas the mere act of aggressively seeking the illicit acqui-
                                     sition of weapons of mass destruction creates an existen-
                                     tial threat to Israel, particularly in light of Iran’s illegal
                                     threats and armed hostilities against Israel, as well as a
                                     grave threat to peace and stability of the region in viola-

                                  Whereas in the Six-Day War, Israel was forced to engage in
                                     successful military action against Egypt under similar
                                     circumstances on June 5, 1967;
                                  Whereas the United States Department of State concluded
                                     that the Six-Day War is ‘‘the most cited example’’ of the

                                          Syria’s Al-Kibar nuclear facility, an ally of Iran who has
                                          been engaged in the murder of Israeli citizens and mili-

                                  Whereas the United States has recognized, since 2002
                                     through the National Security Strategy, that the United
                                     States ‘‘must adapt the concept of imminent threat to

                                  Whereas in 1979 and 1980, Iran has been involved in the
                                     kidnapping of United States citizens and diplomatic per-
                                     sonnel, in direct violation of international law, and assist-
