                                      Calling for the protection of religious minority rights and

                                  Whereas, on January 25, 2011, in Tahrir Square, Egyptian
                                     protestors found their voice when they successfully ended
                                     the 30-plus year rule of President Mubarak and began
                                     the work of creating a true democratic government, a
                                     government that supports and protects inalienable rights
                                     and freedoms, including the freedom of religion;
                                  Whereas the fervor and spirit of these revolutions have taken
                                     wing in other Arab nations such as Tunisia, Libya, and
                                     Syria;
                                  Whereas, reminiscent of the 1968 ‘‘Prague Spring’’ in the





                                     former Czechoslovakia, many have called this revolu-
                                     tionary period an ‘‘Arab Spring’’, where ordinary citizens



                                                                                             2

                                  Whereas, in the midst of newly acquired freedoms, including
                                     those of speech, press, and assembly, it is extremely im-
                                     portant that religious minorities in these countries be
                                     protected from violence and guaranteed the freedom to
                                     practice their religion and to express religious thought;
                                  Whereas Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human
                                     Rights recognizes that ‘‘[e]veryone has the right to free-

                                     public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in
                                     teaching, practice, worship, and observance’’;
                                  Whereas the freedom to worship by minority religious com-
                                     munities in Arab nations has come under repeated and

                                  Whereas, on November 1, 2010, the deadliest ever recorded
                                     attack on Iraqi Christians occurred at the Sayidat al-

                                     where militants stormed the church and detonated 2 sui-

                                  Whereas, on January 1, 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself

                                     in Cairo, killing 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians, a Chris-

                                     courageously sought to release Aasia Bibi, a Christian
                                     woman and mother of 5 who was sentenced to death
                                     under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, was gunned down by
