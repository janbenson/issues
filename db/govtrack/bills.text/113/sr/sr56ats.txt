                                      GILLIBRAND, and Mr. BROWN) submitted the following resolution; which
                                      was considered and agreed to




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                          A resolution recognizing the significance of the 100th
                                           anniversary of the death of Harriet Ross Tubman.

                                  Whereas Harriet Ross Tubman was born into slavery near
                                     Buckstown, Maryland, in or around the year 1820, to her
                                     parents Benjamin Ross and Harriet Green, and was
                                     named Araminta Ross;
                                  Whereas, as a child slave, Tubman checked muskrat traps
                                     along the marshes of the Blackwater River in Dorchester
                                     County, Maryland, and later worked in the fields and for-
                                     ests surrounding the Brodess Plantation;
                                  Whereas, as a teenage slave, Tubman worked as a seamstress





                                     on the Cook Plantation in Dorchester County, Maryland,
                                     and changed her name to Harriet;



                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas, at the age of 24, Tubman married a free black man
                                     named John Tubman, though she remained a slave;
                                  Whereas, in 1849, upon hearing news that she was to be sold
                                     to settle the debts of her late master, Tubman escaped
                                     from slavery to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, marking the
                                     first of many expeditions to and from the Eastern Shore
                                     of Maryland to lead nearly 70 slaves out of slavery;
                                  Whereas, over the course of the next 11 years, from 1849 to
                                     1860, Tubman became a famous conductor of the Under-
                                     ground Railroad, proclaiming in her later years, ‘‘I never
                                     ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger.’’;
                                  Whereas, since the journeys to freedom by Tubman took
                                     place over the winter months when the nights were long
                                     and dark, her groups made stops along the extensive Un-
                                     derground Railroad, first traveling to the Quaker commu-
                                     nity of Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland, even-
                                     tually making stops at the homes of Quaker abolitionist
                                     Thomas Garrett in Wilmington, Delaware, and African-
                                     American abolitionist and future civil rights activist Wil-
                                     liam Still in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before final re-
                                     settlement in Canada;
                                  Whereas, in the late 1850s, Tubman began to speak before
                                     abolitionist audiences to share her dedication and unwav-
                                     ering commitment to the abolitionist cause and the eman-
                                     cipation of slaves;
                                  Whereas Tubman drew admiration from African-American
                                     abolitionist Frederick Douglass, a fellow Eastern Shore
                                     native of Talbot County, Maryland, who stated, ‘‘I know
                                     of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and





                                     hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have.’’;

                                     one the most famous conductors along the Underground
                                     Railroad and has dedicated a theater in honor of Tub-

                                  Whereas, in 1859, Tubman purchased a home and several
                                     acres of land in Auburn, New York, from William Henry
                                     Seward, then United States Senator from New York and
                                     future Secretary of State for President Abraham Lincoln;
                                  Whereas Tubman attended her first Women’s Rights Conven-
                                     tion in Boston, Massachusetts in 1860, beginning a life-
                                     long commitment to the suffrage movement;
                                  Whereas, at the start of the Civil War in 1861, Tubman be-
                                     lieved that a Union victory would be a key stepping stone
                                     to the abolition of slavery and vowed to assist the cause,
                                     joining abolitionist Bostonians and Philadelphians who
                                     traveled to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to pro-
                                     vide aid to the Union war effort;
                                  Whereas Tubman used the skills that she learned evading de-
                                     tection and capture on the Underground Railroad to
                                     serve as a spy and scout for the Union camp at Port
                                     Royal, South Carolina in addition to providing care to
                                     Union forces as a nurse and cook;
                                  Whereas, in 1863, the same year that the Emancipation
                                     Proclamation was issued, Tubman became the first
                                     woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War on
                                     the Raid on Combahee Ferry;
                                  Whereas Tubman led bands of scouts along the marshes and

                                     Colonel Montgomery and a detachment of 300 men from
                                     the 2nd Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Infantry
                                     (African Descent) through the mine-laden waters of the

                                     where the Union forces liberated nearly 750 slaves;
                                  Whereas Tubman assisted the newly liberated slaves in the
                                     years following the raid and tended to wounded soldiers

                                     right to vote, Tubman replied, ‘‘I suffered enough to be-
                                     lieve it.’’;
                                  Whereas, in 1903, Tubman deeded her property to the Afri-
