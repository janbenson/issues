                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Designating the last full week of July 2013 as ‘‘National
                                      Moth Week’’, recognizing the importance of moths in
                                      the United States, and recognizing the value of National
                                      Moth Week for promoting the conservation of moths
                                      and increasing the awareness, study, and appreciation
                                      of moths, their incredible biodiversity, and their impor-
                                      tance to ecosystem health.

                                  Whereas moths are an incredibly diverse type of insect, with
                                     more than 12,000 species in the continental United
                                     States and Canada;





                                  Whereas moths live everywhere and in every habitat, from
                                     inner cities to the most remote and wild places;



                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas moths are important pollinators and are an essential
                                     part of the food web, providing food for a vast number
                                     of birds, bats, and other animals;
                                  Whereas moths are indicators of a healthy environment, as
                                     habitats rich in moths are diverse in other insects and
                                     wildlife;
                                  Whereas monitoring the diversity and distribution of moths
                                     can provide vital clues to changes in the environment;
                                  Whereas knowledge about many moths and moth caterpillars
                                     is limited;
                                  Whereas scientists believe that many moth species may be de-
                                     clining;
                                  Whereas the lack of natural history information about many
                                     moth species provides an opportunity for an individual to
                                     potentially make a meaningful scientific contribution re-
                                     lating to moths;
                                  Whereas National Moth Week, which was established in 2011
                                     in East Brunswick, New Jersey by the Friends of the
                                     East Brunswick Environmental Commission, is a national

                                     much-needed attention on moths and their ecological,
                                     educational, and cultural significance;
                                  Whereas participants of National Moth Week events collect
                                     valuable information about moths and make that infor-
                                     mation available to naturalists, ecologists, and conserva-
                                     tion scientists;
                                  Whereas National Moth Week is intended to encourage every-





                                     one, especially citizen scientists, to help increase knowl-
                                     edge about moths through observation and study;
