                                     created equal, that they are endowed by their creator
                                     with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,
                                     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’’;

                                  Whereas the history of the United States includes injustices
                                     and the denial of basic, fundamental rights at odds with
                                     the words of the founders of the United States and the
                                     sacrifices commemorated at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania;

                                     lynchings, denial of both fundamental human and civil
                                     rights, and withholding of the basic rights of citizenship;

                                  Whereas many African-American men and women worked
                                     against racism to achieve success, such as James

                                     Clara Brown, and many others who were pivotal in the

                                     stated, ‘‘We have a wonderful history behind us. . . . If
