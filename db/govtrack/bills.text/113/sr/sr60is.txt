                                                              RESOLUTION
                                                      Supporting women’s reproductive health.

                                  Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is
                                     critical to improving the health and well-being of women
                                     and their families;
                                  Whereas access to affordable contraceptives and medically ac-
                                     curate information prevents unintended pregnancies,
                                     thereby improving the health of women, children, fami-
                                     lies, and society as a whole;
                                  Whereas title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.
                                     300 et seq.) and the Medicaid program under title XIX
                                     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) cover
                                     health care and family planning services for millions of





                                     women and men who do not have other insurance cov-
                                     erage, with the Medicaid program alone covering 71 per-



                                                                                             2
                                          cent of publicly funded family planning services and more
                                          than 40 percent of all births in the United States;
                                  Whereas women need access to comprehensive, affordable in-
                                     surance that covers family planning services, prenatal
                                     and postnatal care, miscarriage management, labor and
                                     delivery services, and abortion; and
                                  Whereas the lack of adequate prenatal care increases the
                                     risks of infant and maternal mortality and preterm birth,
                                     which cost our health care system approximately
                                     $26,000,000,000 annually: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the Senate supports efforts to—

                                    6                        (2) ensure that the millions of women who rely
