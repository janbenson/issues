<p nid="t0:ih:11">Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the conditions for the United States becoming a signatory to the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, or to any similar agreement on the arms trade.</p><p nid="t0:ih:12">Whereas in October 2009, the United States voted in the United Nations General Assembly to participate in the negotiation of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty;</p><p nid="t0:ih:13">Whereas in July 2012, the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty convened to negotiate the text of the Arms Trade Treaty;</p><p nid="t0:ih:14">Whereas in December 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voted to hold a final negotiating conference on the Arms Trade Treaty in March 2013, on the basis of the text of July 2012;</p><p nid="t0:ih:15">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty poses significant risks to the national security, foreign policy, and economic interests of the United States as well as to the constitutional rights of United States citizens and United States sovereignty;</p><p nid="t0:ih:16">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty fails to expressly recognize the fundamental, individual right to keep and to bear arms and the individual right of personal self-defense, as well as the legitimacy of hunting, sports shooting, and other lawful activities pertaining to the private ownership of firearms and related materials, and thus risks infringing on freedoms protected by the Second Amendment;</p><p nid="t0:ih:17">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty places free democracies and totalitarian regimes on a basis of equality, recognizing their equal right to transfer arms, and is thereby dangerous to the security of the United States;</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty&#x2019;s criteria for assessing the potential consequences of arms transfers are vague, easily politicized, and readily manipulated;</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty&#x2019;s model for using these criteria is incompatible with the decisionmaking model for arms transfers employed by the United States under Presidential Decision Directive 34, which dates from 1995;</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">Whereas the Arms Trade Treaty will create opportunities to engage in &#x2018;lawfare&#x2019;
