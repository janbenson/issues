                                      Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would
                                           be detrimental to the United States economy.

                                  Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released
                                     from fossil fuels;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including
                                     the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home
                                     heating oil;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers
                                     will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and elec-
                                     tricity;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elder-
                                     ly, and those on fixed incomes;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses
                                     moving overseas;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth;
                                  Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a
                                     carbon tax;
                                  Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administra-
                                     tion, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption
                                     was 82 percent;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good
                                     manufactured in the United States;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens
                                     on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic re-
                                     gions and would further restrict the global competitive-





                                     ness of the United States;
                                  Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy
                                     exploration and development and has increased produc-

                                          tion of domestic energy resources on private and State-
                                          owned land which has created significant job growth and
                                          private capital investment;
                                  Whereas United States energy policy should encourage con-
                                     tinued private sector innovation and development and not
                                     increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers;
                                  Whereas the production of American energy resources in-
                                     creases the United States ability to maintain a competi-
                                     tive advantage in today’s global economy;
                                  Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America’s global competi-
                                     tiveness and would encourage development abroad in
                                     countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden;
                                     and
                                  Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on pro-
                                     growth solutions that encourage increased development of
                                     domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it

                                    2 concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon
