                                          CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States
                                     Fish and Wildlife Service should incorporate consider-
                                     ation of global warming and sea-level rise into the com-
                                     prehensive conservation plans for coastal national wildlife
                                     refuges, and for other purposes.

                                  Whereas global warming can generally be described as an in-
                                     crease in the average temperature of the earth’s atmos-
                                     phere, and sea-level rise can best be described as an over-
                                     all increase in sea level;
                                  Whereas global warming and related aspects of climate
                                     change are caused by the emissions of carbon dioxide and





                                     other greenhouse gases due to industrial processes and
                                     fossil fuel combustion associated with the process of eco-



                                                                                             2
                                          nomic growth, and changes in land use such as deforest-
                                          ation;
                                  Whereas studies show that the continuation of historical
                                     trends of greenhouse gas emissions will result in addi-
                                     tional global warming, with current projections of global
                                     warming 2.5°F to 10.4°F by 2100;
                                  Whereas global warming will induce sea-level rise that will
                                     steadily inundate coastal areas, change precipitation pat-
                                     terns, increase risk of droughts and floods, threaten bio-
                                     diversity, and offer a host of potential challenges to pub-
                                     lic health;
                                  Whereas the generally expected 50 to 200 cm sea-level rise
                                     from global warming would inundate 7,000 square miles
                                     of dry land in the United States and equal amounts of
                                     coastal wetlands;
                                  Whereas such sea-level rise will effectively force recreational
                                     beaches inland, exacerbate coastal flooding, and increase
                                     the salinity of aquifers and estuaries in the next century;
                                  Whereas it has been reported that the accumulation of carbon
                                     dioxide in the atmosphere now will persist for approxi-
                                     mately 100 years;
                                  Whereas if we are not proactive in our efforts to reduce
                                     greenhouse gas emissions and wait to see obvious effects
                                     of global warming and sea-level rise, it may be too late
                                     to avoid the harmful repercussions of such events;
                                  Whereas the ongoing and projected estimates of sea-level rise
                                     as a result of global warming threaten the loss of 22 per-
                                     cent of the world’s coastal wetlands by 2080;





                                  Whereas the ongoing and projected increases in sea-level rise
                                     as a result of global warming have extremely strong im-

                                  Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System was created to
                                     conserve fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats;
                                  Whereas the effects of global warming and sea-level rise may
                                     greatly impact the effectiveness of the National Wildlife
                                     Refuge System in the conservation of migratory birds,
                                     anadromous and interjurisdictional fish, marine mam-
                                     mals, endangered species and threatened species, and the

                                  Whereas global warming and sea-level rise has already begun
                                     to affect some of the Nation’s most valued natural re-
                                     sources such as the coral reefs near Buck Island National
