<ul><p nid="t0:rh:879">(a) Means-tested Direct Spending-</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:880">(1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period preceding fiscal year 2014 is 6.7 percent.</p><p nid="t0:rh:881">(2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2014 is 6.2 percent under current law.</p><p nid="t0:rh:882">(3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent resolution for means-tested direct spending:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:883">(A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic president reformed welfare by limiting the duration of benefits, giving States more control over the program, and helping recipients find work. In the five years following passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare caseloads fell, and workers&#x2019; wages increased. This budget applies the lessons of welfare reform to both the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid.</p><p nid="t0:rh:884">(B) For Medicaid, this budget converts the Federal share of Medicaid spending into a flexible State allotment tailored to meet each State&#x2019;s needs, indexed for inflation and population growth. Such a reform would end the misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has tied the hands of State governments. Instead, each State would have the freedom and flexibility to tailor a Medicaid program that fits the needs of its unique population. Moreover, this budget repeals the Medicaid expansions in the President&#x2019;s health care law, relieving State governments of its crippling one-size-fits-all enrollment mandates.</p><p nid="t0:rh:885">(C) For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, this budget converts the program into a flexible State allotment tailored to meet each State&#x2019;s needs, increases in the Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan index and beneficiary growth. Such a reform would provide incentives for States to ensure dollars will go towards those who need them most. Additionally, it requires that more stringent work requirements and time limits apply under the program.</p></ul></ul><p nid="t0:rh:886">(b) Nonmeans-tested Direct Spending-</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:887">(1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period preceding fiscal year 2014 is 5.9 percent.</p><p nid="t0:rh:888">(2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2014 is 5.3 percent under current law.</p><p nid="t0:rh:889">(3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:890">(A) For Medicare, this budget advances policies to put seniors, not the Federal Government, in control of their health care decisions. Those in or near retirement will see no changes, while future retirees would be given a choice of private plans competing alongside the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare would provide a premium-support payment either to pay for or offset the premium of the plan chosen by the senior, depending on the plan&#x2019;s cost. The Medicare premium-support payment would be adjusted so that the sick would receive higher payments if their conditions worsened; lower-income seniors would receive additional assistance to help cover out-of-pocket costs; and wealthier seniors would assume responsibility for a greater share of their premiums. Putting seniors in charge of how their health care dollars are spent will force providers to compete against each other on price and quality.

The Congressional Budget Office uses fair-value accounting to measure the costs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but determines the cost of other Federal housing programs on the basis of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (&#x2018;FCRA&#x2019;).</p><p nid="t0:rh:941">(2) The fair-value accounting method uses discount rates which incorporate the risk inherent to the type of liability being estimated in addition to Treasury discount rates of the proper maturity length. In contrast, cash-basis accounting solely uses the discount rates of the Treasury, failing to incorporate risks such as prepayment and default risk.</p><p nid="t0:rh:942">(3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the $635 billion of loans and loan guarantees issued in 2013 alone would generate budgetary savings of $45 billion over their lifetime using FCRA accounting. However, these same loans and loan guarantees would have a lifetime cost of $11 billion under fair-value methodology.</p><p nid="t0:rh:943">(4) The majority of loans and guarantees issued in 2013 would show deficit reduction of $9.1 billion under FCRA methodology, but would increase the deficit by $4.7 billion using fair-value accounting.</p></ul><p nid="t0:rh:944">(b) Fair Value Estimates- Upon the request of the chair or ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, any estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office for a measure under the terms of title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, &#x2018;credit reform&#x2019;, as a supplement to such estimate shall, to the extent practicable, also provide an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the &#x2018;fair value&#x2019; of assets and liabilities affected by such measure.</p><p nid="t0:rh:945">(c) Fair Value Estimates for Housing Programs- Whenever the Director of the Congressional Budget Office prepares an estimate pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out any bill or joint resolution and if the Director determines that such bill or joint resolution has a cost related to a housing or residential mortgage program under the FCRA, then the Director shall also provide an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the &#x2018;fair value&#x2019; of assets and liabilities affected by the provisions of such bill or joint resolution that result in such cost.</p><p nid="t0:rh:946">(d) Enforcement- If the Director of the Congressional Budget Office provides an estimate pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), the chair of the Committee on the Budget may use such estimate to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budgetary enforcement controls.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:rh:947">SEC. 608.

<p/><h3 nid="t0:rh:958">SEC. 701. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:rh:959">(a) Findings- The House finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:960">(1) Although the U.S. economy technically emerged from recession roughly four years ago, the recovery has felt more like a malaise than a rebound with the unemployment rate still elevated and real economic growth essentially flat in the final quarter of 2012.</p><p nid="t0:rh:961">(2) The enormous build-up of Government debt in the past four years has worsened the already unsustainable course of Federal finances and is an increasing drag on the U.S. economy.</p><p nid="t0:rh:962">(3) During the recession and early stages of recovery, the Government took a variety of measures to try to boost economic activity. Despite the fact that these stimulus measures added over $1 trillion to the debt, the economy continues to perform at a sub-par trend.</p><p nid="t0:rh:963">(4) Investors and businesses make decisions on a forward-looking basis. They know that today&#x2019;s large debt levels are simply tomorrow&#x2019;s tax hikes, interest rate increases, or inflation - and they act accordingly. It is this debt overhang, and the uncertainty it generates, that is weighing on U.S. growth, investment, and job creation.</p><p nid="t0:rh:964">(5) Economists have found that the key to jump-starting U.S. economic growth and job creation is tangible action to rein in the growth of Government spending with the aim of getting debt under control.</p><p nid="t0:rh:965">(6) Stanford economist John Taylor has concluded that reducing Government spending now would &#x2018;reduce the threats of higher taxes, higher interest rates and a fiscal crisis&#x2019;, and would therefore provide an immediate stimulus to the economy.</p><p nid="t0:rh:966">(7) Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has stated that putting in place a credible plan to reduce future deficits &#x2018;would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence.&#x2019;</p><p nid="t0:rh:967">(8) Lowering spending would boost market confidence and lessen uncertainty, leading to a spark in economic expansion, job creation, and higher wages and income.</p></ul><p nid="t0:rh:968">(b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation- It is the policy of this resolution to promote faster economic growth and job creation. By putting the budget on a sustainable path, this resolution ends the debt-fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code put American businesses and workers in a better position to compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This resolution targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve as means to the larger end of growing the economy and expanding opportunity for all Americans.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:rh:969">SEC. 702. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:rh:970">(a) Findings- The House finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:971">(1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The U.S. tax code fails on all three counts - it is notoriously complex, patently unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code&#x2019;s complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job creation.</p><p nid="t0:rh:972">(2) Since 2001 alone, there have been more than 3,250 changes to the code. Many of the major changes over the years have involved carving out special preferences, exclusions, or deductions for various activities or groups. These loopholes add up to more than $1 trillion per year and make the code unfair, inefficient, and very complex.</p><p nid="t0:rh:973">(3) These tax preferences are disproportionately used by upper-income individuals. For instance, the top 1 percent of taxpayers reap about 3 times as much benefit from special tax credits and deductions (excluding refundable credits) than the middle class and 13 times as much benefit than the lowest income quintile.</p><p nid="t0:rh:974">(4) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the code end up narrowing the tax base by as much as 50 percent. A narrow tax base, in turn, requires much higher tax rates to raise a given amount of revenue.</p><p nid="t0:rh:975">(5) The National Taxpayer Advocate reports that taxpayers spent 6.1 billion hours in 2012 complying with tax requirements.</p><p nid="t0:rh:976">(6) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax rates dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher marginal tax rates.</p><p nid="t0:rh:977">(7) Roughly half of U.S. active business income and half of private sector employment are derived from business entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships) that are taxed on a &#x2018;pass-through&#x2019; basis, meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses in particular tend to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, and the top Federal rate on such small business income reaches 44.6 percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires lowering marginal rates on these pass-through entities.</p><p nid="t0:rh:978">(8) The U.S. corporate income tax rate (including Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to just over 39 percent, the highest rate in the industrialized world. The total Federal marginal tax rate on corporate income now reaches 55 percent, when including the shareholder-level tax on dividends and capital gains. Tax rates this high suppress wages and discourage investment and job creation, distort business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors.</p><p nid="t0:rh:979">(9) By deterring potential investment, the U.S. corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The U.S. tax rate differential with other countries also fosters a variety of complicated multinational corporate behaviors intended to avoid the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate revenue.</p><p nid="t0:rh:980">(10) The &#x2018;worldwide&#x2019; structure of U.S. international taxation essentially taxes earnings of U.S. firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage with competitors with more competitive international tax systems.</p><p nid="t0:rh:981">(11) Reforming the U.S. tax code to a more competitive international system would boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies operating abroad and it would also greatly reduce tax avoidance.</p><p nid="t0:rh:982">(12) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors in diminished returns.</p><p nid="t0:rh:983">(13) Revenues have averaged 18 percent of the economy throughout modern American history. Revenues rise above this level under current law to 19.1 percent of the economy, and - if the spending restraints in this budget are enacted - this level is sufficient to fund Government operations over time.</p><p nid="t0:rh:984">(14) Attempting to raise revenue through tax increases to meet out-of-control spending would sink the economy.</p><p nid="t0:rh:985">(15) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not constitute fundamental tax reform.</p><p nid="t0:rh:986">(16) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the board - not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Tax reform should be revenue-neutral and should not be an excuse to raise taxes on the American people.</p></ul><p nid="t0:rh:987">(b) Policy on Tax Reform- It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should enact legislation during fiscal year 2014 that provides for a comprehensive reform of the U.S. tax code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, and workers through revenue-neutral fundamental tax reform, which should be reported by the Committee on Ways and Means to the House not later than December 31, 2013, that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:988">(1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and resources necessary to comply with tax laws;</p><p nid="t0:rh:989">(2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals, with a goal of achieving a top individual rate of 25 percent and consolidating the current seven individual income tax brackets into two brackets with a first bracket of 10 percent;</p><p nid="t0:rh:990">(3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;</p><p nid="t0:rh:991">(4) reduces the corporate tax rate to 25 percent; and</p><p nid="t0:rh:992">(5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system of international taxation.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:rh:993">SEC. 703.

As a result of that law--</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:1000">(A) IPAB will be tasked with keeping the Medicare per capita growth below a Medicare per capita target growth rate.

Since enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the &#x2018;three-legged stool&#x2019; of retirement security, which includes employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1015">(2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended that Social Security&#x2019;s long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:1016">(A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted and program revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1017">(B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1018">(C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2033, benefits will be cut 25 percent across the board, devastating those currently in or near retirement and those who rely on Social Security the most.</p></ul><p nid="t0:rh:1019">(3) The recession and continued low economic growth have exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. The most recent CBO projections find that Social Security will run cash deficits of $1.319 trillion over the next 10 years.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1020">(4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, reforms should take into consideration the need to protect lower-income Americans&#x2019; retirement security.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1021">(5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential income safety net for those with disabilities and their families. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), between 1970 and 2012, the number of people receiving disability benefits (both disabled workers and their dependent family members) has increased by over 300 percent from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase is not due strictly to population growth or decreases in health. David Autor and Mark Duggan have found that the increase in individuals on disability does not reflect a decrease in self-reported health. CBO attributes program growth to changes in demographics, changes in the composition of the labor force and compensation, as well as Federal policies.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1022">(6) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face benefit cuts of up to 25 percent in 2016, devastating individuals who need assistance the most.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1023">(7) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It is critical that bipartisan action be taken to address the looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security remains a critical part of the safety net.</p></ul><p nid="t0:rh:1024">(b) Policy Statement on Social Security- It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law trigger, such that:</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:1025">(1) If in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, the Board of Trustees shall, no later than September 30 of the same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations for statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th-year. Recommendations provided to the President must be agreed upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of Trustees.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1026">(2) Not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in which the Board of Trustees submit their recommendations, the President shall promptly submit implementing legislation to both Houses of Congress including his recommendations necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th year. The Majority Leader of the Senate and the Majority Leader of the House shall introduce the President&#x2019;s legislation upon receipt.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1027">(3) Within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has been referred shall report the bill which shall be considered by the full House or Senate under expedited procedures.</p><p nid="t0:rh:1028">(4) Legislation submitted by the President shall--</p><ul><p nid="t0:rh:1029">(A) protect those in or near retirement;</p><p nid="t0:rh:1030">(B) preserve the safety net for those who count on Social Security the most, including those with disabilities and survivors;</p><p nid="t0:rh:1031">(C) improve fairness for participants;</p><p nid="t0:rh:1032">(D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty for, future generations; and</p><p nid="t0:rh:1033">(E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance program while addressing the needs of those with disabilities today and improving the determination process.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:rh:1034">SEC. 705.
