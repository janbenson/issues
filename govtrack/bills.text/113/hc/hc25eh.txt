10            SPENDING
11   SEC. 501. DIRECT SPENDING.

12       (a) MEANS-TESTED DIRECT SPENDING.—
13              (1) For means-tested direct spending, the aver-
14       age rate of growth in the total level of outlays dur-
15       ing the 10-year period preceding fiscal year 2014 is
16       6.7 percent.
17              (2) For means-tested direct spending, the esti-
18       mated average rate of growth in the total level of
19       outlays during the 10-year period beginning with fis-
20       cal year 2014 is 6.2 percent under current law.
21              (3) The following reforms are proposed in this
22       concurrent resolution for means-tested direct spend-
23       ing:
24                   (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a
25              Democratic president reformed welfare by lim-
26              iting the duration of benefits, giving States
      •HCON 25 EH           52
1            more control over the program, and helping re-
2            cipients find work. In the five years following
3            passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare case-
4            loads fell, and workers’ wages increased. This
5            budget applies the lessons of welfare reform to
6            both the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
7            Program and Medicaid.
8                  (B) For Medicaid, this budget converts the
9            Federal share of Medicaid spending into a flexi-
10           ble State allotment tailored to meet each
11           State’s needs, indexed for inflation and popu-
12           lation growth. Such a reform would end the
13           misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has
14           tied the hands of State governments. Instead,
15           each State would have the freedom and flexi-
16           bility to tailor a Medicaid program that fits the
17           needs of its unique population. Moreover, this
18           budget repeals the Medicaid expansions in the
19           President’s health care law, relieving State gov-
20           ernments of its crippling one-size-fits-all enroll-
21           ment mandates.
22                 (C) For the Supplemental Nutrition As-
23           sistance Program, this budget converts the pro-
24           gram into a flexible State allotment tailored to
25           meet each State’s needs, increases in the De-

1            partment of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan
2            index and beneficiary growth. Such a reform
3            would provide incentives for States to ensure
4            dollars will go towards those who need them
5            most. Additionally, it requires that more strin-
6            gent work requirements and time limits apply
7            under the program.
 8     (b) NONMEANS-TESTED DIRECT SPENDING.—
 9           (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the
10     average rate of growth in the total level of outlays
11     during the 10-year period preceding fiscal year 2014
12     is 5.9 percent.
13           (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the
14     estimated average rate of growth in the total level of
15     outlays during the 10-year period beginning with fis-
16     cal year 2014 is 5.3 percent under current law.
17           (3) The following reforms are proposed in this
18     concurrent resolution for nonmeans-tested direct
19     spending:
20                 (A) For Medicare, this budget advances
21           policies to put seniors, not the Federal Govern-
22           ment, in control of their health care decisions.
23           Those in or near retirement will see no changes,
24           while future retirees would be given a choice of
25           private plans competing alongside the tradi-


     •HCON 25 EH           54
1            tional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medi-
2            care would provide a premium-support payment
3            either to pay for or offset the premium of the
4            plan chosen by the senior, depending on the
5            plan’s cost. The Medicare premium-support
6            payment would be adjusted so that the sick
7            would receive higher payments if their condi-
8            tions worsened; lower-income seniors would re-
9            ceive additional assistance to help cover out-of-
10           pocket costs; and wealthier seniors would as-
11           sume responsibility for a greater share of their
12           premiums. Putting seniors in charge of how
13           their health care dollars are spent will force
14           providers to compete against each other on
15           price and quality. This market competition will
16           act as a real check on widespread waste and
17           skyrocketing health care costs.
18                 (B) In keeping with a recommendation
19           from the National Commission on Fiscal Re-
20           sponsibility and Reform, this budget calls for
21           Federal employees—including Members of Con-
22           gress and congressional staff—to make greater
23           contributions toward their own retirement.

 2                ENFORCEMENT
 3   SEC. 601. LIMITATION ON ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS.

 4       (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
 5            (1) The Veterans Health Care Budget and Re-
 6       form Transparency Act of 2009 provides advance
 7       appropriations for the following veteran medical care
 8       accounts: Medical Services, Medical Support and
 9       Compliance, and Medical Facilities.
10            (2) The President has yet to submit a budget
11       request as required under section 1105(a) of title
12       31, United States Code, including the request for
13       the Department of Veterans Affairs, for fiscal year
14       2014, hence the request for veteran medical care ad-
15       vance appropriations for fiscal year 2015 is unavail-
16       able as of the writing of this concurrent resolution.
17            (3) This concurrent resolution reflects the most
18       up-to-date estimate on veterans’ health care needs
19       included in the President’s fiscal year 2013 request
20       for fiscal year 2015.
21       (b) IN GENERAL.—In the House, except as provided
22 for in subsection (c), any bill or joint resolution, or amend-
23 ment thereto or conference report thereon, making a gen-
24 eral appropriation or continuing appropriation may not
25 provide for advance appropriations.


      •HCON 25 EH            56
 1       (c) EXCEPTIONS.—An advance appropriation may be

 4 to accompany this concurrent resolution or the joint ex-
 5 planatory statement of managers to accompany this con-
 6 current resolution under the heading ‘‘Accounts Identified
 7 for Advance Appropriations’’.
 8       (d) LIMITATIONS.—For fiscal year 2015, the aggre-
 9 gate level of advance appropriations shall not exceed—
10              (1) $55,483,000,000 for the following programs
11       in the Department of Veterans Affairs—
12                  (A) Medical Services;
13                  (B) Medical Support and Compliance; and
14                  (C) Medical Facilities accounts of the Vet-

17       for all programs identified pursuant to subsection
18       (c).
19       (e) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term ‘‘advance
20 appropriation’’ means any new discretionary budget au-
21 thority provided in a bill or joint resolution, or amendment
22 thereto or conference report thereon, making general ap-
23 propriations or any new discretionary budget authority
24 provided in a bill or joint resolution making continuing

10 SPENDING LEVELS.—If a committee (other than the Com-

12 or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, pro-
13 viding for a decrease in direct spending (budget authority
14 and outlays flowing therefrom) for any fiscal year and also
15 provides for an authorization of appropriations for the
16 same purpose, upon the enactment of such measure, the
17 chair of the Committee on the Budget may decrease the
18 allocation to such committee and increase the allocation
19 of discretionary spending (budget authority and outlays

21 for fiscal year 2014 by an amount equal to the new budget
22 authority (and outlays flowing therefrom) provided for in

 7             (B) In missing the statutory date by which the
 8         budget must be submitted, this will be the fourth
 9         time in five years the President has not complied
10         with that deadline.
11             (C) This concurrent resolution reflects the lev-

14         ation;
15              (2) take effect upon the enactment of that
16         measure; and
17              (3) be published in the Congressional Record as

      •HCON 25 EH           62
 1       (c) BUDGET COMPLIANCE.—(1) The consideration of
 2 any bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or con-

      •HCON 25 EH           63
1    SEC. 607. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES.

2        (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
3             (1) Costs of Federal housing loans and loan
4        guarantees are treated unequally in the budget. The
5        Congressional Budget Office uses fair-value account-
6        ing to measure the costs of Fannie Mae and Freddie
7        Mac, but determines the cost of other Federal hous-
8        ing programs on the basis of the Federal Credit Re-
9        form Act of 1990 (‘‘FCRA’’).
10            (2) The fair-value accounting method uses dis-
11       count rates which incorporate the risk inherent to
12       the type of liability being estimated in addition to
13       Treasury discount rates of the proper maturity
14       length. In contrast, cash-basis accounting solely uses
15       the discount rates of the Treasury, failing to incor-
16       porate risks such as prepayment and default risk.
17            (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates
18       that the $635 billion of loans and loan guarantees
19       issued in 2013 alone would generate budgetary sav-
20       ings of $45 billion over their lifetime using FCRA
21       accounting. However, these same loans and loan
22       guarantees would have a lifetime cost of $11 billion
23       under fair-value methodology.
24            (4) The majority of loans and guarantees issued
25       in 2013 would show deficit reduction of $9.1 billion


      •HCON 25 EH            64
 1       under FCRA methodology, but would increase the
 2       deficit by $4.7 billion using fair-value accounting.
 3       (b) FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.—Upon the request of
 4 the chair or ranking member of the Committee on the
 5 Budget, any estimate prepared by the Director of the Con-
 6 gressional Budget Office for a measure under the terms
 7 of title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, ‘‘credit
 8 reform’’, as a supplement to such estimate shall, to the
 9 extent practicable, also provide an estimate of the current
10 actual or estimated market values representing the ‘‘fair
11 value’’ of assets and liabilities affected by such measure.
12       (c) FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES          FOR   HOUSING PRO-
13   GRAMS.—Whenever       the Director of the Congressional
14 Budget Office prepares an estimate pursuant to section
15 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 of the costs
16 which would be incurred in carrying out any bill or joint
17 resolution and if the Director determines that such bill
18 or joint resolution has a cost related to a housing or resi-
19 dential mortgage program under the FCRA, then the Di-
20 rector shall also provide an estimate of the current actual
21 or estimated market values representing the ‘‘fair value’’
22 of assets and liabilities affected by the provisions of such
23 bill or joint resolution that result in such cost.
24       (d) ENFORCEMENT.—If the Director of the Congres-
25 sional Budget Office provides an estimate pursuant to


      •HCON 25 EH             65
 1 subsection (b) or (c), the chair of the Committee on the
 2 Budget may use such estimate to determine compliance
 3 with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other
 4 budgetary enforcement controls.

 8       For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of
 9 1974, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Con-
10 trol Act of 1985, or the rules or orders of the House of
11 Representatives, a bill or joint resolution, or an amend-
12 ment thereto or conference report thereon, that transfers
13 funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the High-
14 way Trust Fund shall be counted as new budget authority
15 and outlays equal to the amount of the transfer in the
16 fiscal year the transfer occurs.

20       (a) ALLOCATION.—In the House, there shall be a sep-
21 arate allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for
22 overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism.
23 For purposes of enforcing such separate allocation under
24 section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,
25 the ‘‘first fiscal year’’ and the ‘‘total of fiscal years’’ shall


      •HCON 25 EH           66
 1 be deemed to refer to fiscal year 2014. Such separate allo-
 2 cation shall be the exclusive allocation for overseas contin-
 3 gency operations/global war on terrorism under section
 4 302(a) of such Act. Section 302(c) of such Act shall not
 5 apply to such separate allocation. The Committee on Ap-
 6 propriations may provide suballocations of such separate
 7 allocation under section 302(b) of such Act. Spending that
 8 counts toward the allocation established by this section
 9 shall be designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii)
10 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
11 Act of 1985.
12       (b) ADJUSTMENT.—In the House, for purposes of
13 subsection (a) for fiscal year 2014, no adjustment shall
14 be made under section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget
15 Act of 1974 if any adjustment would be made under sec-
16 tion 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emer-
17 gency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

25       sistent with other such rules; and

2        right of the House of Representatives to change
3        those rules at any time, in the same manner, and to
4        the same extent as in the case of any other rule of
5        the House of Representatives.
6    TITLE VII—POLICY STATEMENTS
7    SEC. 701. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
8                   JOB CREATION.
9        (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
10            (1) Although the U.S. economy technically
11       emerged from recession roughly four years ago, the
12       recovery has felt more like a malaise than a rebound
13       with the unemployment rate still elevated and real
14       economic growth essentially flat in the final quarter
15       of 2012.
16            (2) The enormous build-up of Government debt
17       in the past four years has worsened the already
18       unsustainable course of Federal finances and is an
19       increasing drag on the U.S. economy.
20            (3) During the recession and early stages of re-
21       covery, the Government took a variety of measures
22       to try to boost economic activity. Despite the fact
23       that these stimulus measures added over $1 trillion
24       to the debt, the economy continues to perform at a
25       sub-par trend.


      •HCON 25 EH         68
1            (4) Investors and businesses make decisions on
2      a forward-looking basis. They know that today’s
3      large debt levels are simply tomorrow’s tax hikes, in-
4      terest rate increases, or inflation – and they act ac-
5      cordingly. It is this debt overhang, and the uncer-
6      tainty it generates, that is weighing on U.S. growth,
7      investment, and job creation.
8            (5) Economists have found that the key to
9      jump-starting U.S. economic growth and job cre-
10     ation is tangible action to rein in the growth of Gov-
11     ernment spending with the aim of getting debt
12     under control.
13           (6) Stanford economist John Taylor has con-
14     cluded that reducing Government spending now
15     would ‘‘reduce the threats of higher taxes, higher in-
16     terest rates and a fiscal crisis’’, and would therefore
17     provide an immediate stimulus to the economy.
18           (7) Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
19     has stated that putting in place a credible plan to
20     reduce future deficits ‘‘would not only enhance eco-
21     nomic performance in the long run, but could also
22     yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-
23     term interest rates and increased consumer and
24     business confidence.’’




     •HCON 25 EH             69
 1            (8) Lowering spending would boost market con-
 2       fidence and lessen uncertainty, leading to a spark in
 3       economic expansion, job creation, and higher wages
 4       and income.
 5       (b) POLICY    ON   ECONOMIC GROWTH      AND   JOB CRE-
 6   ATION.—It   is the policy of this resolution to promote fast-
 7 er economic growth and job creation. By putting the budg-
 8 et on a sustainable path, this resolution ends the debt-
 9 fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to
10 the tax code put American businesses and workers in a
11 better position to compete and thrive in the 21st century
12 global economy. This resolution targets the regulatory red
13 tape and cronyism that stack the deck in favor of special
14 interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve as
15 means to the larger end of growing the economy and ex-
16 panding opportunity for all Americans.
17   SEC. 702. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

18       (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
19            (1) A world-class tax system should be simple,
20       fair, and promote (rather than impede) economic
21       growth. The U.S. tax code fails on all three counts
22       – it is notoriously complex, patently unfair, and
23       highly inefficient. The tax code’s complexity distorts
24       decisions to work, save, and invest, which leads to




      •HCON 25 EH         70
 1     slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job
 2     creation.
 3           (2) Since 2001 alone, there have been more
 4     than 3,250 changes to the code. Many of the major
 5     changes over the years have involved carving out
 6     special preferences, exclusions, or deductions for var-
 7     ious activities or groups. These loopholes add up to
 8     more than $1 trillion per year and make the code
 9     unfair, inefficient, and very complex.
10           (3) These tax preferences are disproportionately
11     used by upper-income individuals. For instance, the
12     top 1 percent of taxpayers reap about 3 times as
13     much benefit from special tax credits and deductions
14     (excluding refundable credits) than the middle class
15     and 13 times as much benefit than the lowest in-
16     come quintile.
17           (4) The large amount of tax preferences that
18     pervade the code end up narrowing the tax base by
19     as much as 50 percent. A narrow tax base, in turn,
20     requires much higher tax rates to raise a given
21     amount of revenue.
22           (5) The National Taxpayer Advocate reports
23     that taxpayers spent 6.1 billion hours in 2012 com-
24     plying with tax requirements.




     •HCON 25 EH          71
1            (6) Standard economic theory shows that high
2      marginal tax rates dampen the incentives to work,
3      save, and invest, which reduces economic output and
4      job creation. Lower economic output, in turn, mutes
5      the intended revenue gain from higher marginal tax
6      rates.
7            (7) Roughly half of U.S. active business income
8      and half of private sector employment are derived
9      from business entities (such as partnerships, S cor-
10     porations, and sole proprietorships) that are taxed
11     on a ‘‘pass-through’’ basis, meaning the income
12     flows through to the tax returns of the individual
13     owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure
14     rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses
15     in particular tend to choose this form for Federal
16     tax purposes, and the top Federal rate on such small
17     business income reaches 44.6 percent. For these rea-
18     sons, sound economic policy requires lowering mar-
19     ginal rates on these pass-through entities.
20           (8) The U.S. corporate income tax rate (includ-
21     ing Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to just
22     over 39 percent, the highest rate in the industri-
23     alized world. The total Federal marginal tax rate on
24     corporate income now reaches 55 percent, when in-
25     cluding the shareholder-level tax on dividends and


     •HCON 25 EH          72
 1     capital gains. Tax rates this high suppress wages
 2     and discourage investment and job creation, distort
 3     business activity, and put American businesses at a
 4     competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors.
 5           (9) By deterring potential investment, the U.S.
 6     corporate tax restrains economic growth and job cre-
 7     ation. The U.S. tax rate differential with other coun-
 8     tries also fosters a variety of complicated multi-
 9     national corporate behaviors intended to avoid the
10     tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base
11     offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing
12     corporate revenue.
13           (10) The ‘‘worldwide’’ structure of U.S. inter-
14     national taxation essentially taxes earnings of U.S.
15     firms twice, putting them at a significant competi-
16     tive disadvantage with competitors with more com-
17     petitive international tax systems.
18           (11) Reforming the U.S. tax code to a more
19     competitive international system would boost the
20     competitiveness of U.S. companies operating abroad
21     and it would also greatly reduce tax avoidance.
22           (12) The tax code imposes costs on American
23     workers through lower wages, on consumers in high-
24     er prices, and on investors in diminished returns.




     •HCON 25 EH           73
 1           (13) Revenues have averaged 18 percent of the
 2      economy throughout modern American history. Rev-
 3      enues rise above this level under current law to 19.1
 4      percent of the economy, and – if the spending re-
 5      straints in this budget are enacted – this level is suf-
 6      ficient to fund Government operations over time.
 7           (14) Attempting to raise revenue through tax
 8      increases to meet out-of-control spending would sink
 9      the economy.
10           (15) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending
11      does not constitute fundamental tax reform.
12           (16) The goal of tax reform should be to curb
13      or eliminate loopholes and use those savings to lower
14      tax rates across the board – not to fund more waste-
15      ful Government spending. Tax reform should be rev-
16      enue-neutral and should not be an excuse to raise
17      taxes on the American people.
18      (b) POLICY ON TAX REFORM.—It is the policy of this
19 resolution that Congress should enact legislation during
20 fiscal year 2014 that provides for a comprehensive reform
21 of the U.S. tax code to promote economic growth, create
22 American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American con-
23 sumers, investors, and workers through revenue-neutral

     •HCON 25 EH            74
1 Committee on Ways and Means to the House not later
2 than December 31, 2013, that—
3             (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to
4        American families and businesses and reduces the
5        amount of time and resources necessary to comply
6        with tax laws;
7             (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individ-
8        uals, with a goal of achieving a top individual rate
9        of 25 percent and consolidating the current seven in-
10       dividual income tax brackets into two brackets with
11       a first bracket of 10 percent;
12            (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;
13            (4) reduces the corporate tax rate to 25 per-
14       cent; and
15            (5) transitions the tax code to a more competi-
16       tive system of international taxation.
17   SEC. 703. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

18       (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
19            (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on
20       Medicare for their health security.
21            (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeat-
22       edly recommended that Medicare’s long-term finan-
23       cial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without
24       reform, the financial condition of Medicare becomes
25       more precarious and the threat to those in or near


      •HCON 25 EH          75
 1     retirement becomes more pronounced. According to
 2     the Congressional Budget Office—
 3                 (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
 4           will be exhausted in 2023 and unable to pay
 5           scheduled benefits; and
 6                 (B) Medicare spending is growing faster
 7           than the economy and Medicare outlays are
 8           currently rising at a rate of 6.2 percent per
 9           year, and under the Congressional Budget Of-
10           fice’s alternative fiscal scenario, direct spending
11           on Medicare is projected to exceed 7 percent of
12           GDP by 2040 and reach 13 percent of GDP by
13           2085.
14           (3) The President’s health care law created a
15     new Federal agency called the Independent Payment
16     Advisory Board (‘‘IPAB’’) empowered with unilat-
17     eral authority to cut Medicare spending. As a result
18     of that law—
19                 (A) IPAB will be tasked with keeping the
20           Medicare per capita growth below a Medicare
21           per capita target growth rate. Prior to 2018,
22           the target growth rate is based on the five-year
23           average of overall inflation and medical infla-
24           tion. Beginning in 2018, the target growth rate
25           will be the five-year average increase in the


     •HCON 25 EH               76
 1            nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus
 2            one percentage point;
 3                  (B) the fifteen unelected, unaccountable
 4            bureaucrats of IPAB will make decisions that
 5            will reduce seniors access to care;
 6                  (C) the nonpartisan Office of the Medicare
 7            Chief Actuary estimates that the provider cuts
 8            already contained in the Affordable Care Act
 9            will force 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nurs-
10            ing facilities, and home health agencies to close
11            in 2019; and
12                  (D) additional cuts from the IPAB board
13            will force even more health care providers to
14            close their doors, and the Board should be re-
15            pealed.
16            (4) Failing to address this problem will leave
17      millions of American seniors without adequate health
18      security and younger generations burdened with
19      enormous debt to pay for spending levels that cannot
20      be sustained.
21      (b) POLICY      ON   MEDICARE REFORM.—It is the policy
22 of this resolution to protect those in or near retirement
23 from any disruptions to their Medicare benefits and offer
24 future beneficiaries the same health care options available
25 to Members of Congress.


      •HCON 25 EH              77
 1       (c) ASSUMPTIONS.—This resolution assumes reform
 2 of the Medicare program such that:
 3            (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for
 4       those in or near retirement.
 5            (2) For future generations, when they reach eli-
 6       gibility, Medicare is reformed to provide a premium
 7       support payment and a selection of guaranteed
 8       health coverage options from which recipients can
 9       choose a plan that best suits their needs.
10            (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-
11       service as an option.
12            (4) Medicare will provide additional assistance
13       for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater
14       health risks.
15            (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable
16       path and the Medicare program becomes solvent
17       over the long-term.
18   SEC. 704. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

19       (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
20            (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals
21       with disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Se-
22       curity. Since enactment, Social Security has served
23       as a vital leg on the ‘‘three-legged stool’’ of retire-
24       ment security, which includes employer provided
25       pensions as well as personal savings.


      •HCON 25 EH          78
1            (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has re-
2      peatedly recommended that Social Security’s long-
3      term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each
4      year without reform, the financial condition of Social
5      Security becomes more precarious and the threat to
6      seniors and those receiving Social Security disability
7      benefits becomes more pronounced:
8                  (A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance
9            Trust Fund will be exhausted and program rev-
10           enues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
11                 (B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and
12           Survivors and Disability Trust Funds will be
13           exhausted, and program revenues will be unable
14           to pay scheduled benefits.
15                 (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust
16           Funds in 2033, benefits will be cut 25 percent
17           across the board, devastating those currently in
18           or near retirement and those who rely on Social
19           Security the most.
20           (3) The recession and continued low economic
21     growth have exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis
22     facing Social Security. The most recent CBO projec-
23     tions find that Social Security will run cash deficits
24     of $1.319 trillion over the next 10 years.




     •HCON 25 EH            79
1            (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Se-
2      curity for a larger proportion of their retirement in-
3      come. Therefore, reforms should take into consider-
4      ation the need to protect lower-income Americans’
5      retirement security.
6            (5) The Disability Insurance program provides
7      an essential income safety net for those with disabil-
8      ities and their families. According to the Congres-
9      sional Budget Office (CBO), between 1970 and
10     2012, the number of people receiving disability bene-
11     fits (both disabled workers and their dependent fam-
12     ily members) has increased by over 300 percent
13     from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase
14     is not due strictly to population growth or decreases
15     in health. David Autor and Mark Duggan have
16     found that the increase in individuals on disability
17     does not reflect a decrease in self-reported health.
18     CBO attributes program growth to changes in demo-
19     graphics, changes in the composition of the labor
20     force and compensation, as well as Federal policies.
21           (6) If this program is not reformed, families
22     who rely on the lifeline that disability benefits pro-
23     vide will face benefit cuts of up to 25 percent in
24     2016, devastating individuals who need assistance
25     the most.


     •HCON 25 EH           80
 1            (7) Americans deserve action by the President,
 2      the House, and the Senate to preserve and strength-
 3      en Social Security. It is critical that bipartisan ac-
 4      tion be taken to address the looming insolvency of
 5      Social Security. In this spirit, this resolution creates
 6      a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions by requir-
 7      ing policymakers to ensure that Social Security re-
 8      mains a critical part of the safety net.
 9      (b) POLICY STATEMENT       ON   SOCIAL SECURITY.—It
10 is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work
11 on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security sustainably
12 solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law
13 trigger, such that:
14            (1) If in any year the Board of Trustees of the
15      Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust
16      Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust
17      Fund annual Trustees Report determines that the
18      75-year actuarial balance of the Social Security
19      Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of
20      the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is
21      in deficit, the Board of Trustees shall, no later than
22      September 30 of the same calendar year, submit to
23      the President recommendations for statutory re-
24      forms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actu-
25      arial balance and a positive annual balance in the


      •HCON 25 EH           81
 1     75th-year. Recommendations provided to the Presi-
 2     dent must be agreed upon by both Public Trustees
 3     of the Board of Trustees.
 4           (2) Not later than December 1 of the same cal-
 5     endar year in which the Board of Trustees submit
 6     their recommendations, the President shall promptly
 7     submit implementing legislation to both Houses of
 8     Congress including his recommendations necessary
 9     to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and
10     a positive annual balance in the 75th year. The Ma-
11     jority Leader of the Senate and the Majority Leader
12     of the House shall introduce the President’s legisla-
13     tion upon receipt.
14           (3) Within 60 days of the President submitting
15     legislation, the committees of jurisdiction to which
16     the legislation has been referred shall report the bill
17     which shall be considered by the full House or Sen-
18     ate under expedited procedures.
19           (4) Legislation submitted by the President
20     shall—
21                 (A) protect those in or near retirement;
22                 (B) preserve the safety net for those who
23           count on Social Security the most, including
24           those with disabilities and survivors;
25                 (C) improve fairness for participants;


     •HCON 25 EH               82
1                     (D) reduce the burden on, and provide cer-
2             tainty for, future generations; and
3                     (E) secure the future of the Disability In-
4             surance program while addressing the needs of
5             those with disabilities today and improving the
6             determination process.
7    SEC. 705. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AF-
8                   FORDABILITY.
9        (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
10            (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to eco-
11       nomic, job, and wage growth.
12            (2) More than 21 million students are enrolled
13       in American colleges and universities.
14            (3) Over the last decade, tuition and fees have
15       been growing at an unsustainable rate. Between the
16       2001-2002 Academic Year and the 2011-2012 Aca-
17       demic Year:
18                    (A) Published tuition and fees for in-State
19            students at public four-year colleges and univer-
20            sities increased at an average rate of 5.6 per-
21            cent per year beyond the rate of general infla-
22            tion.
23                    (B) Published tuition and fees for in-State
24            students at public two-year colleges and univer-
25            sities increased at an average rate of 3.8 per-


      •HCON 25 EH             83
1            cent per year beyond the rate of general infla-
2            tion.
3                    (C) Published tuition and fees for in-State
4            students at private four-year colleges and uni-
5            versities increased at an average rate of 2.6
6            percent per year beyond the rate of general in-
7            flation.
8            (4) Over that same period, Federal financial aid
9      has increased 140 percent beyond the rate of general
10     inflation.
11           (5) This spending has failed to make college
12     more affordable.
13           (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address,
14     President Obama noted that, ‘‘We can’t just keep
15     subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of
16     money.’’
17           (7) American students are chasing ever-increas-
18     ing tuition with ever-increasing debt. According to
19     the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student
20     debt nearly tripled between 2004 and 2012, and now
21     stands at nearly $1 trillion. Student debt now has
22     the second largest balance after mortgage debt.
23           (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and
24     too many fail to complete college or end up default-




     •HCON 25 EH              84
 1       ing on these loans due to their debt burden and a
 2       weak economy and job market.
 3             (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional
 4       Budget Office, the Pell Grant Program will face a
 5       fiscal shortfall beginning in fiscal year 2015 and
 6       continuing in each subsequent year in the current
 7       budget window.
 8             (10) Failing to address these problems will
 9       jeopardize access and affordability to higher edu-
10       cation for America’s young people.
11       (b) POLICY       ON   HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORD-
12   ABILITY.—It    is the policy of this resolution to address the
13 root drivers of tuition inflation, by—
14             (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those
15       most in need;
16             (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to
17       make them more effective;
18             (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award
19       level at $5,645 in each year of the budget window;
20       and
21             (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher edu-
22       cation that act to restrict flexibility and innovative
23       teaching, particularly as it relates to non-traditional
24       models such as online coursework and competency-
25       based learning.

2                   THROUGH THE CANCELLATION OF UNOBLI-
3                   GATED BALANCES.

4        (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
5             (1) According to the last available estimate
6        from the Office of Management and Budget, Federal
7        agencies were expected to hold $698 billion in unob-
8        ligated balances at the close of fiscal year 2013.
9             (2) These funds represent direct and discre-
10       tionary spending made available by Congress that
11       remains available for expenditure beyond the fiscal
12       year for which they are provided.
13            (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding
14       and it remains available for obligation indefinitely.
15            (4) The Congressional Budget and Impound-
16       ment Control Act of 1974 requires the Office of
17       Management and Budget to make funds available to
18       agencies for obligation and prohibits the Administra-
19       tion from withholding or cancelling unobligated
20       funds unless approved by an act of Congress.
21            (5) Greater congressional oversight is required
22       to review and identify potential savings from
23       unneeded balances of funds.
24       (b) POLICY STATEMENT         ON    DEFICIT REDUCTION
25 THROUGH     THE    CANCELLATION     OF   UNOBLIGATED BAL-
26   ANCES.—Congressional     committees shall through their
      •HCON 25 EH            86
 1 oversight activities identify and achieve savings through
 2 the cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that
 3 neither abrogate contractual obligations of the Govern-
 4 ment nor reduce or disrupt Federal commitments under
 5 programs such as Social Security, veterans’ affairs, na-
 6 tional security, and Treasury authority to finance the na-
 7 tional debt.
 8       (c) DEFICIT REDUCTION.—Congress, with the assist-
 9 ance of the Government Accountability Office, the Inspec-
10 tors General, and other appropriate agencies should make
11 it a high priority to review unobligated balances and iden-
12 tify savings for deficit reduction.

14                  SHIP OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
15       (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
16            (1) The House of Representatives cut budgets
17       for Members of Congress, House committees, and
18       leadership offices by 5 percent in 2011 and an addi-
19       tional 6.4 percent in 2012.
20            (2) The House of Representatives achieved sav-
21       ings of $36.5 million over three years by consoli-
22       dating House operations and renegotiating con-
23       tracts.
24       (b) POLICY.—It is the policy of this resolution that:




      •HCON 25 EH           87
1             (1) The House of Representatives must be a
2       model for the responsible stewardship of taxpayer re-
3       sources and therefore must identify any savings that
4       can be achieved through greater productivity and ef-
5       ficiency gains in the operation and maintenance of
6       House services and resources like printing, con-
7       ferences, utilities, telecommunications, furniture,
8       grounds maintenance, postage, and rent. This should
9       include a review of policies and procedures for acqui-
10      sition of goods and services to eliminate any unnec-
11      essary spending. The Committee on House Adminis-
12      tration should review the policies pertaining to the
13      services provided to Members and committees of the
14      House, and should identify ways to reduce any sub-
15      sidies paid for the operation of the House gym, bar-
16      ber shop, salon, and the House dining room.
17            (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase

22                  SARY AND WASTEFUL SPENDING.

23      (a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the following:
24            (1) The Government Accountability Office
25      (‘‘GAO’’) is required by law to identify examples of


      •HCON 25 EH          88
 1     waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal programs,
 2     and has so identified dozens of such examples.
 3           (2) In testimony before the Committee on Over-
 4     sight and Government Reform, the Comptroller Gen-
 5     eral has stated that addressing the identified waste,
 6     duplication, and overlap in Federal programs ‘‘could
 7     potentially save tens of billions of dollars.’’
 8           (3) In 2011 and 2012, the Government Ac-
 9     countability Office issued reports showing excessive
10     duplication and redundancy in Federal programs in-

1                  (D) 17 separate Homeland Security pre-
2            paredness grant programs that spent $37 bil-
3            lion between fiscal year 2011 and 2012;
4                  (E) 13 programs, 3 tax benefits, and one
5            loan program to reduce diesel emissions; and
6                  (F) 94 different initiatives run by 11 dif-
7            ferent agencies to encourage ‘‘green building’’
8            in the private sector.
9            (4) The Federal Government spends about $80
10     billion each year for information technology. GAO
11     has identified broad acquisition failures, waste, and
12     unnecessary duplication in the Government’s infor-
13     mation technology infrastructure. Experts have esti-
14     mated that eliminating these problems could save 25
15     percent – or $20 billion – of the Government’s an-
16     nual information technology budget.
17           (5) Federal agencies reported an estimated
18     $108 billion in improper payments in fiscal year
19     2012.
20           (6) Under clause 2 of Rule XI of the Rules of
21     the House of Representatives, each standing com-
22     mittee must hold at least one hearing during each
23     120 day period following its establishment on waste,
24     fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government pro-
25     grams.

 1            (7) According to the Congressional Budget Of-
 2       fice, by fiscal year 2014, 42 laws will expire, possibly
 3       resulting in $685 billion in unauthorized appropria-
 4       tions. Timely reauthorizations of these laws would
 5       ensure assessments of program justification and ef-
 6       fectiveness.
 7            (8) The findings resulting from congressional
 8       oversight of Federal Government programs should
 9       result in programmatic changes in both authorizing
10       statutes and program funding levels.

14 nually shall include in its Views and Estimates letter re-
15 quired under section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget
16 Act of 1974 recommendations to the Committee on the
17 Budget of programs within the jurisdiction of such com-
18 mittee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated.

21       It is the policy of this resolution that the committees
22 of jurisdiction should review all unauthorized programs

 5   SEC. 801. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF
 6                  CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.
 7       It is the sense of the House that—
 8            (1) additional legislative action is needed to en-
 9       sure that States have the necessary resources to col-
10       lect all child support that is owed to families and to
11       allow them to pass 100 percent of support on to
12       families without financial penalty; and
13            (2) when 100 percent of child support payments
14       are passed to the child, rather than administrative
15       expenses, program integrity is improved and child
16       support participation increases.
         Passed the House of Representatives March 21,
     2013.
