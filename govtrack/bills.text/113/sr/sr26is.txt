                                  Recognizing that access to hospitals and other health care providers for
                                      patients in rural areas of the United States is essential to the survival

                                              IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
                                                              FEBRUARY 7, 2013
                                  Mr. MORAN (for himself and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following resolu-
                                      tion; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,
                                      and Pensions




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Recognizing that access to hospitals and other health care
                                     providers for patients in rural areas of the United States
                                     is essential to the survival and success of communities
                                     in the United States.

                                  Whereas access to quality health care services determines
                                     whether individuals in the United States can remain in
                                     the communities they call home and whether their chil-
                                     dren will return to those communities to raise families of
                                     their own;
                                  Whereas more than 60,000,000 individuals in rural areas of
                                     the United States rely on rural hospitals and other pro-





                                     viders as critical access points to health care;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas rural areas of the United States need quality health
                                     care services to attract and retain business and industry;
                                  Whereas, to ensure that communities in the United States
                                     survive and flourish, Congress must address the unique
                                     health care needs of individuals in rural areas of the
                                     United States;
                                  Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States are,
                                     per capita, older, poorer, and sicker than individuals in
                                     urban areas of the United States;
                                  Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human
                                     Services, ‘‘rural areas have higher rates of poverty,
                                     chronic disease, and uninsurance, and millions of rural
                                     Americans have limited access to a primary care pro-

                                  Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, indi-
                                     viduals in rural areas of the United States have higher
                                     rates of age-adjusted mortality, disability, and chronic
                                     disease than individuals in urban areas of the United
                                     States;
                                  Whereas the 20 percent of the population of the United
                                     States that lives in rural areas is scattered over 90 per-
                                     cent of the landmass of the United States;
                                  Whereas the geography and weather of rural areas of the
                                     United States can make accessing health care difficult,
                                     and cultural, social, and language barriers compound
                                     rural health challenges;
                                  Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States are
                                     more likely to be uninsured and more likely to receive





                                     coverage through public sources than individuals in urban
                                     areas of the United States;

                                  Whereas the proportion of uninsured and underinsured indi-
                                     viduals is rising faster in rural areas of the United States
                                     than in urban areas of the United States;
                                  Whereas access to health care continues to be a major chal-

                                          (1) 77 percent of the 2,050 rural counties in the
                                     United States are designated as primary care Health
                                     Professional Shortage Areas (commonly referred to as
                                     ‘‘HPSAs’’);
                                          (2) rural areas of the United States have fewer than
                                     half as many primary care physicians per 100,000 people
                                     as urban areas of the United States; and
                                          (3) more than 50 percent of patients in rural areas
                                     of the United States travel at least 20 miles to receive
                                     specialty medical care, compared to only 6 percent of pa-
                                     tients in urban areas of the United States;
                                  Whereas, because rural hospitals and other providers face
                                     unique challenges in administering care to patients, Con-

                                           (1) specific programs to address rural hospital clo-
                                     sures that occurred in the 1980s by providing financial
                                     support to hospitals that are geographically isolated and
                                     in which Medicare patients make up a significant per-
                                     centage of hospital inpatient days or discharges; and
                                           (2) a program established in 1997 to support lim-

                                  Whereas, in addition to the vital care that rural health care
                                     providers provide to patients, rural health care providers
                                     are critical to the local economies of their communities
                                     and are one of the largest types of employers in rural
                                     areas of the United States where, on average, 14 percent
                                     of total employment is attributed to the health sector;
                                  Whereas a hospital in a rural area of the United States is
                                     typically one of the top 2 largest employers in that area;

                                     ally generates approximately $2,700,000 in total revenue;
                                  Whereas the average Critical Access Hospital, a limited-serv-
                                     ice rural health care facility, creates 107 jobs and gen-

                                     can amount to 20 percent of the output of a rural com-
