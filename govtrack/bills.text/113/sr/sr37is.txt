                                  Whereas there are over 300 intercollegiate wrestling pro-
                                     grams in the United States;
                                  Whereas wrestling represents the determination and hard
                                     work it takes to succeed in life and sport;
                                  Whereas the United States has a long, proud, and storied
                                     Olympic wrestling history; and
                                  Whereas wrestling epitomizes the spirit of the Olympic
                                     Games: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the Senate—
