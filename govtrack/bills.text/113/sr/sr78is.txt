                                     achieving advances in civil and human rights in the

                                     people, especially the people who are most vulnerable;
                                  Whereas the programs and services provided by professional
                                     social workers are essential elements of the social safety
                                     net in the United States;





                                  Whereas social workers have a critical impact on adolescent
                                     and youth development, aging and family caregiving,


                                                                                             2

                                  Whereas social workers function as specialists, consultants,
                                     private practitioners, educators, community leaders, pol-
                                     icymakers, and researchers;
                                  Whereas social workers influence many different organiza-
                                     tions and human service systems and are employed in a
                                     wide range of workplaces, including private and public
                                     agencies, hospices and hospitals, schools, clinics, busi-

                                  Whereas social workers seek to improve social functioning
                                     and social conditions for people in emotional, psycho-
                                     logical, economic, or physical need;

                                  Whereas social workers have roles in more than 50 different
                                     fields of practice;
                                  Whereas social workers believe that the strength of a country
                                     depends on the ability of the majority of the people to
                                     lead productive and healthy lives;
                                  Whereas social workers help people, who are often navigating
                                     major life challenges, find hope and new options for
                                     achieving their maximum potential; and
                                  Whereas social workers identify and address gaps in social





                                     systems that impede full participation by individuals or
                                     groups in society: Now, therefore, be it
