                                                    of National Ag Day.

                                  Whereas, in 1973, the National Ag Day program was estab-
                                     lished to increase public awareness of the vital role of ag-
                                     riculture in the United States;
                                  Whereas the agriculture industry is part of the very fabric of
                                     the United States, driving the economy, fostering inge-
                                     nuity, and preserving the deepest values of the people of
                                     the United States;
                                  Whereas the average farmer in the United States today feeds
                                     nearly 150 people, a dramatic increase from just 25 peo-

                                  Whereas the agriculture industry in the United States pro-
                                     duces an incredible variety of meats, grains, fruits, vege-
                                     tables, dairy, beans, nuts, seeds, and other important
                                     foods;
                                  Whereas more than 2,000,000 farmers and ranchers con-
                                     tribute more than $300,000,000,000 to the United States
                                     economy every year; and
                                  Whereas farmers comprise less than 2 percent of the popu-
                                     lation of the United States, yet produce more than
                                     enough food for the people of the United States and hun-
