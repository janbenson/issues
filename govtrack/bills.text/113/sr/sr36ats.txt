                                  Recognizing February 19, 2013 as the centennial of Mosaic, a faith-based

                                              IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
                                                            FEBRUARY 14, 2013
                                  Mr. JOHANNS (for himself, Mr. HARKIN, Mrs. FISCHER, Mr. DURBIN, and
                                      Mr. GRASSLEY) submitted the following resolution; which was considered
                                      and agreed to




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Recognizing February 19, 2013 as the centennial of Mosaic,
                                     a faith-based organization that was founded in Nebraska
                                     and now serves more than 3,600 individuals with intellec-
                                     tual disabilities in 10 States.

                                  Whereas the roots of Mosaic, a faith-based organization that
                                     serves individuals with intellectual disabilities, trace back
                                     to the commitment of a Nebraskan to ensure that indi-
                                     viduals with disabilities were cared for and inspired by a
                                     loving community;
                                  Whereas, on February 19, 1913, a Nebraska pastor, the Rev-
                                     erend K.G. William Dahl, founded Bethphage Inner Mis-





                                     sion Association (referred to in this preamble as
                                     ‘‘Bethphage’’) in Axtell, Nebraska as a ministry for indi-
                                     viduals with intellectual disabilities;


                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas, on October 20, 1925, a school endeavoring to create
                                     opportunities for children with disabilities took root in
                                     Sterling, Nebraska when the Reverends Julius Moehl,
                                     August Hoeger, and William Fruehling, and laymen John
                                     Aden and William Ehmen, established Martin Luther
                                     Home Society, which later became known as Martin Lu-
                                     ther Homes;
                                  Whereas, with the increasing need for community-based pro-
                                     grams for individuals with disabilities in the 1970s and
                                     1980s, both Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes grew
                                     into ministries that served locations across the United
                                     States;
                                  Whereas the shared vision and mission of the 2 Nebraska-
                                     born ministries, to care for the most vulnerable individ-
                                     uals, laid the foundation for the formation of a powerful
                                     partnership;
                                  Whereas, on July 1, 2003, Mosaic was officially established
                                     through a consolidation of Bethphage and Martin Luther
                                     Homes; and
                                  Whereas Mosaic has created a legacy of love, providing indi-
                                     vidualized support to thousands of individuals in the
                                     United States and extending its work beyond the borders
                                     of the United States through an international alliance:
                                     Now therefore be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the Senate—

                                    4                        (2) recognizes the important and valuable con-
