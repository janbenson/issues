<p>Supporting the designation of March 2013, as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.</p><p>Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, killing more non-smokers than any other cancer;</p><p>Whereas every year it is estimated that more than 135,000 individuals in the United States are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 individuals die from the disease;</p><p>Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly preventable forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that can be removed before becoming cancerous;</p><p>Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best;</p><p>Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that if every individual aged 50 or older had regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented;</p><p>Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses occur at this stage;</p><p>Whereas colorectal cancer screening can effectively reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, yet 1 in 3 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with recommended colorectal cancer screening;</p><p>Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are held during the month of March each year; and</p><p>Whereas educational efforts can help provide information to the public of methods of prevention and screening, as well as about symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it</p><ul><p><em>  Resolved,</em> That the Senate--</p><ul><p>(1) supports the goals and ideals of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month; and</p><p>(2) encourages the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate awareness and educational activities.</p></ul></ul></body>
