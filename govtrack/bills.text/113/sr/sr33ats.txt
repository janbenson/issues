                                     highly accredited programs, including programs in edu-
                                     cation, business, and library and information manage-

                                  Whereas Emporia State University is the alma mater of more
                                     than 75,000 proud alumni; and
                                  Whereas the quality of Emporia State University as an insti-
                                     tution of higher learning is a reflection of the extraor-
