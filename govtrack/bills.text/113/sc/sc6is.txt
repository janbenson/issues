                                              IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                                          CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
                                                     Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act.

                                  Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound re-
                                     cording industries that are the envy of the world, due to
                                     the symbiotic relationship that has existed among those
                                     industries for many decades;
                                  Whereas, for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected re-
                                     peated calls by the recording industry to impose a per-
                                     formance fee on local radio stations for simply playing
                                     music on the radio, as such a fee would upset the mutu-
                                     ally beneficial relationship between local radio and the re-
                                     cording industry;
                                  Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and pro-
                                     motion to the recording industry and performers of music





                                     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers,
                                     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and


                                                                                             2
                                          publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets,
                                          ring tones, music videos, and associated merchandise;
                                  Whereas committees in the Senate and the House of Rep-
                                     resentatives have previously reported that ‘‘the sale of
                                     many sound recordings and the careers of many per-
                                     formers have benefitted considerably from airplay and
                                     other promotional activities provided by both noncommer-
                                     cial and advertiser-supported, free over-the-air broad-
                                     casting’’;
                                  Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands of
                                     hours of essential local news and weather information
                                     during times of national emergencies and natural disas-
                                     ters, such as on September 11, 2001, and during Hurri-
                                     canes Katrina and Rita, as well as public affairs pro-
                                     gramming, sports, and hundreds of millions of dollars
                                     worth of time for public service announcements and local
                                     fund raising efforts for worthy charitable causes, all of
                                     which are jeopardized if local radio stations are forced to
                                     divert revenues to pay for a new performance fee;
                                  Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations
                                     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new per-
                                     formance fee is imposed, as will many other small busi-
                                     nesses that play music including bars, restaurants, retail
                                     establishments, sports and other entertainment venues,
                                     shopping centers, and transportation facilities; and
                                  Whereas the hardship that would result from a new perform-
                                     ance fee would hurt businesses in the United States, and
                                     ultimately the consumers in the United States who rely
                                     on local radio for news, weather, and entertainment, and





                                     such a performance fee is not justified when the current
                                     system has produced the most prolific and innovative

                                    2 concurring), That Congress should not impose any new
