<p>To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize a bipartisan majority of Commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission to hold nonpublic collaborative discussions, and for other purposes.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Federal Communications Commission Collaboration Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission (in this section referred to as the &#8216;Commission&#8217;), past and present, have stated that, while they support the intent of section 552b of title 5, United States Code, the implementation of that section has hindered the ability of the Commission to have a substantive exchange of ideas and hold collective deliberations on issues pending before the Commission.</p><p>(2) The principal purpose of Congress in creating a multimember agency is to obtain the benefits of collegial decisionmaking by the members of the agency, who bring to the decisionmaking process different philosophical perspectives, experiences, and areas of expertise.</p><p>(3) Commissioners have relied primarily on an inefficient combination of written messages, communications among staff, and a series of meetings restricted to 2 Commissioners at each such meeting to discuss complex telecommunications matters pending before the Commission.</p><p>(4) Extensive use of such methods of communication has harmed collegiality and cooperation at the Commission.</p><p>(5) Numerous regulatory matters have been pending before the Commission for years, and continued inaction on these issues has the potential to hinder innovation and private investment in the domestic communications industry.</p><p>(6) The Commission must be able to work more collaboratively and efficiently than in the past to meet the current challenge of expanding broadband Internet access to the extent necessary to serve the business, educational, health, and cultural needs of all people in the United States.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. NONPUBLIC COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.</h3>
