                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              Congress finds the following:


                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a dev-
                                    2              astating neurologic disease leading to blindness and
                                    3              paralysis.
                                    4                        (2) There are an estimated 11,000 patients
                                    5              with NMO in the United States.
                                    6                        (3) Women are affected 7 to 9 times more than
                                    7              men, and a large proportion of NMO patients are
                                    8              African-American.
                                    9                        (4) The average age at diagnosis is 41 years,
                                  10               but the range is broad and includes children as
                                  11               young as 2 years of age and adults as old as 89
                                  12               years of age.
                                  13                         (5) NMO incurs substantial costs for affected
                                  14               patients and their families.
                                  15                         (6) The cause of NMO is unknown, but it is hy-
                                  16               pothesized to be autoimmune in nature.
                                  17                         (7) More than 90 percent of NMO patients will
                                  18               suffer recurrent disease and accumulate neurologic
                                  19               disability.
                                  20                         (8) Because of their relatively low overall inci-
                                  21               dence, orphan diseases like NMO frequently do not
                                  22               receive sufficient attention and research funding.
                                  23                         (9) No single institution has a sufficient num-




                                  24               ber of patients to independently conduct research
                                  25               that will adequately address the cause of NMO.

                                    5                        (11) We can apply our understanding of NMO
