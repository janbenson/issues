These initiatives should be encouraged and supported by the Federal Government with the concurrence of the relevant Federal land management agencies and tribal governments by providing financial and technical assistance.</p><p nid="t0:ih:34">(4) Partnerships among Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, the private sector, and citizens provide the most viable framework to recognize, conserve, enhance, and interpret the resources of places that have made important contributions to the national story.</p><p nid="t0:ih:35">(5) Communities and regions need assistance to set resource stewardship and interpretive goals, and to implement strategies for resource conservation and renewed economic viability in these areas.</p><p nid="t0:ih:36">(6) A unified national process as well as certain standards for designation of National Heritage Areas need to be established to provide a consistent framework. The process should include a system for approval of heritage area management plans.</p><p nid="t0:ih:37">(7) National Heritage Areas located near or encompassing units of the National Park System provide an additional basis for public enjoyment of parks and park-related resources, and it is appropriate for these parks to participate in, assist with, and benefit from local heritage initiatives that conserve and interpret resources over a larger area beyond the park&#x2019;s boundaries.</p><p nid="t0:ih:38">(8) It is in the national interest, and will benefit future generations, to establish a system of National Heritage Areas to encourage natural and cultural resource conservation, interpretation, enhancement, and economic sustainability, and for full public understanding and appreciation of the many resources, places, events, and peoples that have contributed to the rich heritage of this Nation.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:39">(b) Purposes- The purposes of this Act are to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:40">(1) establish a system of regional and community-based National Heritage Areas to conserve, enhance, and interpret natural, historic, scenic, and cultural resources that together tell nationally significant stories representing our country&#x2019;s heritage;</p><p nid="t0:ih:41">(2) promote public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of the many places, events, and people that have contributed to our diverse national story;</p><p nid="t0:ih:42">(3) promote innovative and partnership-driven management strategies that recognize regional values, to encourage locally tailored resource stewardship and interpretation, to develop economically viable and innovative approaches to community conservation, and to provide for the effective leveraging of Federal funds with State, local, tribal, and private funding sources;</p><p nid="t0:ih:43">(4) provide unified national standards and processes for conducting feasibility studies, designating National Heritage Areas, and approving heritage area management plans;</p><p nid="t0:ih:44">(5) provide appropriate linkages among units of the National Park System, and communities, governments, and organizations within National Heritage Areas to conserve, enhance, and interpret resources outside of park boundaries; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:45">(6) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial and technical assistance to local coordinating entities that act as a catalyst for diverse regions, communities, organizations, and citizens to undertake projects and programs for resource stewardship and interpretation.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:46">SEC. 3.
