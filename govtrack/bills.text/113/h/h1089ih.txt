                                    5              Congress finds the following:
                                    6                        (1) Technology and the Internet have trans-

                                  10               student competitive in the global labor market.
                                  11               America needs an education system that supports
                                  12               students from all walks of life in becoming inquisi-

                                  21               know how to orchestrate the use of these resources
