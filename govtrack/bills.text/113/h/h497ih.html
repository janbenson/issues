This would equate to a 23 percent net growth in computer-related occupations.</p><p>(6) Computer-related occupations with the highest projected growth rates include database administrators, software developers, and network and computer systems administrators.</p><p>(7) As of June 2012, there were approximately 301,214 job openings in the information technology sector.</p><p>(8) According to a recent report, 64 percent of managers hiring for information technology jobs rate certifications as having extremely high or high value in validating information technology skills and expertise, and that value is rated highest by senior managers, such as chief information officers, and by medium-size firms.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
