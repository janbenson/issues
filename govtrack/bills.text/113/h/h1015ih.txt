                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Huntington’s Disease




                                    5 Parity Act of 2013’’.
                                    1     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.                                  2
                                    2              Congress makes the following findings:
                                    3                        (1) Huntington’s Disease is a progressive de-
                                    4              generative neurological disease that causes total
                                    5              physical and mental deterioration. In the United
                                    6              States, approximately 30,000 individuals are af-
                                    7              fected by Huntington’s Disease, along with another
                                    8              200,000 individuals who are genetically ‘‘at risk’’.
                                    9              There is no effective treatment in terms of halting
                                  10               or slowing the progression of the disease.
                                  11                         (2) Clinical indicators of Huntington’s Disease
                                  12               include—
                                  13                                  (A) loss of ability to control bodily move-

                                  15                                  (B) loss of ability to think or act quickly,
                                  16                         inability to learn new material, and loss of
                                  17                         memory; and
                                  18                                  (C) behavioral or psychological problems,
                                  19                         including personality changes, irritability, mood
                                  20                         swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior,
                                  21                         inability to concentrate, decreased motivation,
                                  22                         and severe depression.
                                  23                         (3) Adult-onset Huntington’s Disease typically

                                    6                        (4) Because of the incapacitating nature of
                                    7              Huntington’s Disease, individuals living with this ill-

                                    9              ease, are unable to retain employment. As a result,
                                  10               many such individuals rely solely on Social Security
                                  11               Disability Insurance.
                                  12                         (5) Despite significant advances in medicine
                                  13               and a greater understanding of Huntington’s Dis-
                                  14               ease, the Social Security Administration has not

                                  16               evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985.
                                  17               The designation of this disease by the Social Secu-

                                  19               both outdated and medically inaccurate, as this term
                                  20               fails to recognize the behavioral and cognitive impact
                                  21               of Huntington’s Disease, while also providing an in-
