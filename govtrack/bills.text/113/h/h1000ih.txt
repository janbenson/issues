                                    6                        (2) The Federal Government has previously es-

                                  11                         (3) Pursuant to these Acts, the Congress de-
                                  12               clared it is the continuing policy and responsibility
                                  13               of the Federal Government to use all practicable
                                  14               means to create and maintain conditions which pro-

                                  16               seek them, including the self-employed. Pursuant to
                                  17               these Acts, the Congress declared and established as

                                    3                        (5) The Nation has been deprived of the full
                                    4              supply of goods and services, the full utilization of

                                    8                        (6) The current output of goods and services is
                                    9              insufficient to meet pressing national priorities for

                                  13                         (7) Unemployment and underemployment ex-

                                  16               disruption of family life, the loss of individual dig-
                                  17               nity and self-respect, and the aggravation of physical

                                  19                         (8) Persisting unemployment and underemploy-

                                    4              high levels of unemployment contribute to fore-
                                    5              closures, evictions, and commercial vacancies, under-

                                    8              and national prosperity.
                                    9                        (9) The historic promise of this earlier legisla-
                                  10               tion has not been fully realized, and we re-declare
                                  11               and reaffirm our support for achieving a national

                                  14               important at such times, because it provides a
