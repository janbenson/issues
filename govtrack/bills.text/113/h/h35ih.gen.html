<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">(a) Findings- Congress finds--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) that the Supreme Court has found language nearly identical to the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; to be unconstitutional;</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) that the enactment of the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; has been met with an almost uninterrupted series of horrific and tragic shootings at Columbine, Newtown and in other American schools;</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) that the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; has been a deadly failure. According to research by GeorgiaCarry.org, in the 22 years prior to enactment of the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; there were two school shootings in which four or more people were intentionally murdered in a short period of time, and in the 22 years after the enactment of the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; there have been 10 such school shootings;</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) that American schools had not been plagued with this succession of horrific shootings prior to the enactment of the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019;;</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) that horrific massacres on school campuses in Pearl, Mississippi, and southwestern Virginia, were averted by armed staff and students;</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) that none of the murderers in any of these horrific school shootings were deterred by the fact that, in addition to murder, gun possession was also illegal in those locations; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) that the reason that the &#x2018;Gun Free School Zones Act&#x2019; has made American schools unsafe is that shooters now know that they can victimize American school campuses with no fear that victims will be armed.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:24">(b) Purpose- It is the purpose of this Act to restore safety to America&#x2019;s schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to defend the children and themselves.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:25">SEC. 3.
