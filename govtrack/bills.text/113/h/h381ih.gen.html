SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:14">This Act may be cited as the &#x2018;Reinvesting and Ensuring America&#x2019;s Ability to Lead Act of 2013&#x2019;.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:15">SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) The bedrock of the Nation&#x2019;s economic strength and future growth will be directly attributed to the robust Federal investment in critical areas such as education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Recognizing the importance of education and its role in maintaining America&#x2019;s position as an economic global leader, President George H.W. Bush stated that &#x2018;U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) As President Bill Clinton recognized when he created the National Economic Council in 1992, &#x2018;The currency of national strength in this new era will be denominated not only in ships and tanks and planes, but in diplomas and patents and paychecks.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) Recognizing diplomas and patents will not occur without investing in education, President George W. Bush stated that &#x2018;we must address the low standing of American test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science, the very subjects most likely to affect our future competitiveness.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) Similarly, President Obama has stated that America&#x2019;s future economic growth and international competitiveness depend on our Nation&#x2019;s willingness to educate, invest, and innovate.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) As stated in a recent report from the National Economic Council, the Nation must &#x2018;create the jobs and industries of the future by doing what America does best--investing in the creativity and imagination of our people. To win the future, we must out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) Accordingly, Congress should be provided the means to evaluate legislative worth beyond its impact to the annual budget.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:24">SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:25">Section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (<usc-reference title="2" section="653" paragraph="">2 U.S.C. 653</usc-reference>) is amended by inserting &#x2018;(a)&#x2019; after &#x2018;sec. 402.&#x2019; and by adding at the end the following new subsection:</p><blockquote><p nid="t0:ih:26">&#x2018;(b)(1) The Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare a ten-year long-term cost benefit analysis for each introduced bill or resolution of a public character that determines its impact on American global competitiveness as defined by the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">&#x2018;(2) The Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall devise criteria to evaluate American global competitiveness, including the bill or resolution&#x2019;s impact on--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:28">&#x2018;(A) job creation;</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">&#x2018;(B) economic growth;</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">&#x2018;(C) consumption;</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">&#x2018;(D) investments; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">&#x2018;(E) savings.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:33">&#x2018;(3) The analysis referred to in paragraph (1) shall evaluate whether the introduced bill or resolution will positively or negatively impact America&#x2019;s economic ability to compete globally compared to member nations of the Group of Twenty, or G-20, which comprise of 19 country members and the European Union, accounting 90 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 80 percent of global trade.&#x2019;.</p></blockquote></ul></body>
