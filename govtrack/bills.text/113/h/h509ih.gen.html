<ul><p nid="t0:ih:14">This Act may be cited as the &#x2018;Transition toward Excellence, Achievement, and Mobility through Employment Act of 2013&#x2019; or &#x2018;TEAM-Employment Act of 2013&#x2019;.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:15">SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">(a) Findings- Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way should diminish the opportunity of citizens with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, for full participation in society (including school, work, family, social engagement, interpersonal relationships, and community), independent living, and economic self sufficiency.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Self-determination and informed choice are essential elements in all program and service options.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) Work for pay (employment) is a valued activity both for individuals and society. Employment provides both tangible and intangible benefits. Employment helps people achieve independence and economic self-sufficiency. Employment also gives people purpose, dignity, self-esteem, and a sense of accomplishment and pride as well as an ability to contribute to society as a whole.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) Individuals with disabilities, including those with the most significant disabilities, should enjoy a presumption that they can achieve integrated employment with appropriate services and supports.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) More than 30 years of research and experience demonstrates that all youth, including youth with disabilities, achieve better outcomes when they have access to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:22">(A) high-quality standards-based education in an inclusive setting;</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(B) information about career options and exposure to the world of work, including structured internships;</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(C) participation in post-secondary education;</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">(D) opportunities to develop social, civic, and leadership skills;</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(E) strong connections to caring adults;</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(F) safe places to interact with their peers; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">(G) support services and specific accommodations to allow them to become independent adults.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:29">(6) The diverse and complex needs of today&#x2019;s youth cannot be met by one&#x2019;s family, school district, government program, or private organization acting alone. The successful transition of all youth to adulthood and a productive, independent, self-sufficient life demands coordination and collaboration across agencies, along with an integrated services approach to serving youth at the Federal, State, and local levels.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:30">(b) Purposes- The purposes of this Act are the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:31">(1) To create a systemic focus on cultivating the high expectations for youth with significant disabilities to transition successfully into adulthood and be able to work in integrated employment, earn a liveable wage, and live independently in integrated communities through public policies that advance equality of opportunity, informed choice, employment first principles, and economic self-sufficiency.</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(2) To promote innovative strategies to foster academic, professional, and social inclusion, and the solidification of long-term services and supports required to ensure full integration into the society (including school, work, family, social engagement, interpersonal relationships, and community living).</p><p nid="t0:ih:33">(3) To better define and coordinate specific services related to the effective transition of youth with significant disabilities.</p><p nid="t0:ih:34">(4) To eliminate barriers and provide incentives for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and improve transition services for youth with significant disabilities.</p><p nid="t0:ih:35">(5) To create a holistic system across multiple Federal, State, and local public entities promoting employment first strategies and the successful transition of youth with significant disabilities into adulthood through strengthened coordination among and between public entities, including the alignment of planning processes, implementation systems, and funding streams.</p><p nid="t0:ih:36">(6) To align, enhance, and improve performance and accountability measures among public entities involved in the transition of youth with significant disabilities into adulthood.</p><p nid="t0:ih:37">(7) To provide financial incentives to States to align their planning processes across and within public entities involved in transitioning, strengthen and coordinate regulations to ensure cross-agency emphasis on the promotion of employment first policies and practices, and rebalance resources toward an employment first paradigm to focus on the preferred outcomes of advancing integrated employment, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and community participation for youth and adults with significant disabilities.</p><p nid="t0:ih:38">(8) To ensure proper level of professional development training of publicly financed service delivery professionals involved in the transition of youth with significant disabilities into adulthood on evidence-based promising practices.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:39">SEC. 3.
