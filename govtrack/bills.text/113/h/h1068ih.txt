                                  19                  (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals

                                  33                                (i) are under review by the Obama administration; and

                                  35                  (6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that
                                  36               unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d amend-

                                  38                  (7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment rights
                                  39               of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.
