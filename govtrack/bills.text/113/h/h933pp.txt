                                    6 that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to
                                    7 draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:
                                    8                        (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law en-
                                    9              forcement authorities in conducting investigations by
                                  10               tracking the sale and possession of specific firearms.
                                  11               Law enforcement agencies may request firearms traces
                                  12               for any reason, and those reasons are not necessarily
                                  13               reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms
                                  14               used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced
                                  15               are used in crime.
                                  16                         (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen
                                  17               for purposes of determining which types, makes, or
                                  18               models of firearms are used for illicit purposes. The
                                  19               firearms selected do not constitute a random sample
                                  20               and should not be considered representative of the
                                  21               larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or
                                  22               any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally
