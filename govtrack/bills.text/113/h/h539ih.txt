                                    5              5, United States Code, the implementation of that
                                    6              section has hindered the ability of the Commission
                                    7              to have a substantive exchange of ideas and hold col-

                                  12               of collegial decisionmaking by the members of the
                                  13               agency, who bring to the decisionmaking process dif-
                                  14               ferent philosophical perspectives, experiences, and
                                  15               areas of expertise.
                                  16                         (3) Commissioners have relied primarily on an
                                  17               inefficient combination of written messages, commu-

                                  19               stricted to 2 Commissioners at each such meeting to
                                  20               discuss complex telecommunications matters pending
                                  21               before the Commission.
                                  22                         (4) Extensive use of such methods of commu-
                                  23               nication has harmed collegiality and cooperation at
