<p>To require the Commissioner of Social Security to revise the medical and evaluation criteria for determining disability in a person diagnosed with Huntington&#8217;s Disease and to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare eligibility for individuals disabled by Huntington&#8217;s Disease.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Huntington&#8217;s Disease Parity Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>(1) Huntington&#8217;s Disease is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes total physical and mental deterioration. In the United States, approximately 30,000 individuals are affected by Huntington&#8217;s Disease, along with another 200,000 individuals who are genetically &#8216;at risk&#8217;. There is no effective treatment in terms of halting or slowing the progression of the disease.</p><p>(2) Clinical indicators of Huntington&#8217;s Disease include--</p><ul><p>(A) loss of ability to control bodily movements;</p><p>(B) loss of ability to think or act quickly, inability to learn new material, and loss of memory; and</p><p>(C) behavioral or psychological problems, including personality changes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, inability to concentrate, decreased motivation, and severe depression.</p></ul><p>(3) Adult-onset Huntington&#8217;s Disease typically results in the development of symptoms in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. Late-onset Huntington&#8217;s Disease is characterized by development of symptoms after 50 years of age and is usually associated with a milder course of the disease. Juvenile Huntington&#8217;s Disease affects individuals who have yet to attain 19 years of age and progresses at a more rapid rate.</p><p>(4) Because of the incapacitating nature of Huntington&#8217;s Disease, individuals living with this illness, including those in the early stages of the disease, are unable to retain employment. As a result, many such individuals rely solely on Social Security Disability Insurance.</p><p>(5) Despite significant advances in medicine and a greater understanding of Huntington&#8217;s Disease, the Social Security Administration has not comprehensively revised its rules for the medical evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985. The designation of this disease by the Social Security Administration as &#8216;Huntington&#8217;s Chorea&#8217; is both outdated and medically inaccurate, as this term fails to recognize the behavioral and cognitive impact of Huntington&#8217;s Disease, while also providing an incomplete characterization of the full spectrum of Huntington&#8217;s Disease for purposes of Social Security Disability Insurance and the Medicare program.</p><p>(6) After qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, individuals with Huntington&#8217;s Disease must wait another 24 months before receiving benefits under the Medicare program, despite the fact that such individuals often become incapacitated before reaching the age-eligibility requirement under the Medicare program of 65 years of age.</p><p>(7) In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (&#8216;ALS&#8217;), a degenerative neurological condition that is similar to Huntington&#8217;s Disease.</p><p>(8) In light of the outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington&#8217;s Disease and the significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation faced by individuals with this disease, there is an urgent need for a revision of the medical and evaluation criteria used by the Social Security Administration in determining whether such individuals are disabled, as well as removal of the 24-month waiting period for coverage under the Medicare program for such individuals, similar to the existing exemption for individuals who have been diagnosed with ALS.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
