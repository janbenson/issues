                                    1                        (5) In June 2000, the United States Court of
                                    2              Federal Claims ruled that the Alabama-Coushatta

                                    7              million acres.
                                    8                        (6) In October 2002, the United States Court
                                    9              of Federal Claims adopted the sum of Two Hundred

                                  11               ($270,600,000) as the jointly stipulated amount of

                                  13               Coushatta Tribe from the United States.
                                  14                         (7) There is pending before the United States
                                  15               District Court for the Eastern District of Texas a
                                  16               lawsuit by the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, seeking de-
                                  17               claratory and injunctive relief based on the United
                                  18               States failure to discharge its fiduciary duty to the
                                  19               Tribe.
                                  20                         (8) Despite the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe’s

                                  23               to forego, relinquish, waive, and otherwise disclaim

                                    3                        (9) The Congress shares with the State of
                                    4              Texas and the parties to this litigation a desire to

                                    9                        (10) This legislation represents a good faith ef-
                                  10               fort on the part of Congress to provide the Alabama-
                                  11               Coushatta Tribe with an economic development op-
                                  12               portunity under the same terms and conditions as
                                  13               other federally recognized Indian tribes, in exchange
                                  14               for the Tribe’s agreement to relinquish its rights as
                                  15               described above.
                                  16                         (11) In the absence of Congressional action,
                                  17               these land claims and related claims will be pursued
                                  18               through the courts, a process which in all likelihood
                                  19               will consume many years and thereby promote hos-
