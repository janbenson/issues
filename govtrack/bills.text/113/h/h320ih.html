<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Student Support Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) In General- Subpart 14 of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7269 et seq.) is amended--</p><ul><p>(1) by inserting after the subpart heading the following:</p></ul></ul><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;CHAPTER A--SYSTEMS INTEGRATION; PROMOTION OF SCHOOL READINESS&#8217;;</h3>
</blockquote><ul><p>and</p><ul><p>(2) by adding at the end the following:</p></ul></ul><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;CHAPTER B--SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3>
</blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 5545. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>&#8216;The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has found that although 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of impairment, in any given year fewer than 1 in 3 of these children receives needed treatment. The short- and long-term consequences of untreated childhood mental disorders are costly, in both human and fiscal terms.</p><p>&#8216;(2) School counselors, school psychologists, other qualified psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, and school social workers are needed to help these children and to provide a variety of crucial support services.</p><p>&#8216;(3) Across the United States, there are insufficient resources for school-based counseling professionals, and often students do not get the help they need. The current national average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 471 to 1.</p><p>&#8216;(4) United States schools need more mental health professionals, and they need the flexibility to hire the professionals that will best serve their students.</p><p>&#8216;(5) According to the leading counseling, guidance, and mental health organizations, including the American School Counselor Association, the National Association of Social Psychologists, the National Association of Social Workers, and the School Social Work Association of America, the maximum recommended ratio of--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) students to school counselors is 250 to 1;</p><p>&#8216;(B) students to school psychologists is 1,000 to 1; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) students to school social workers is 250 to 1.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(6) In some States, 1 school counselor typically serves over 1,000 students. Ratios for school psychologists and school social workers are also extremely high. In some schools, there are no school-based mental health and student service providers available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any other time.</p><p>&#8216;(7) The number of students is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. During this time, many school-based mental health professionals who currently serve the Nation&#8217;s youth will retire.</p><p>&#8216;(8) Model programs using school-based mental health and student service providers have reduced school suspensions, reduced referrals to the principal&#8217;s office, reduced the use of weapons, force, and threats, and increased students&#8217; feelings of safety.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 5546. PURPOSES.</h3>
<ul><p>&#8216;The purposes of this chapter are to assist States and local educational agencies in hiring additional school-based mental health providers, including additional school counselors, school psychologists, other qualified psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, and school social workers to achieve each of the following:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(1) To reduce the ratios of school-based mental health and student service providers to students in elementary and secondary schools in the United States to the following minimum ratios recommended by the leading counseling, guidance, and mental health organizations, including the American School Counselor Association, the National Association of Social Psychologists, the National Association of Social Workers, and the School Social Work Association of America:</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) One school counselor for every 250 students;</p><p>&#8216;(B) One school psychologist for every 1,000 students; and</p><p>&#8216;(C) One school social worker for every 250 students.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(2) To provide school-based mental health and student services.</p><p>&#8216;(3) To remove emotional, behavioral, and psychosocial barriers to learning so as to enhance students&#8217; classroom preparedness and ability to learn.</p><p>&#8216;(4) To support school staff and teachers in improving classroom management, conducting behavioral interventions to improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need for mental health services.</p><p>&#8216;(5) To support parental involvement in improving the school behavior and academic success of their children.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 5547.
