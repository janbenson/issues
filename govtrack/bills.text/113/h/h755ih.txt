                                    3     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
                                    4              Congress makes the following findings:
                                    5                        (1) The unpaid volunteer members of the Civil
                                    6              Air Patrol (hereafter in this Act referred to as the

                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (2) During the war, CAP members used their
                                    2              own aircraft to perform a myriad of essential tasks
                                    3              for the military and the Nation within the United
                                    4              States including attacks on enemy submarines off
                                    5              the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United
                                    6              States.
                                    7                        (3) This extraordinary national service set the
                                    8              stage for the post-war CAP to become a valuable
                                    9              nonprofit, public service organization chartered by
                                  10               Congress and designated the Auxiliary of the United

                                  13               States, the Federal Government, and the military.
                                  14                         (4) The CAP was established, initially as a part
                                  15               of the Office of Civil Defense, by air-minded citizens
                                  16               one week before the surprise attack on Pearl Har-
                                  17               bor, Hawaii, on December 1, 1941, out of the desire
                                  18               of civil airmen of the country to be mobilized with
                                  19               their equipment in the common defense of the Na-
                                  20               tion.
                                  21                         (5) Within days of the start of the war, the
                                  22               German Navy started a massive submarine offensive,
                                  23               known as Operation Drumbeat, off the east coast of
                                  24               the United States against oil tankers and other crit-




                                  25               ical shipping that threatened the overall war effort.

                                    1                        (6) Neither the Navy nor the Army had enough
                                    2              aircraft, ships, or other resources to adequately pa-
                                    3              trol and protect the shipping along the Atlantic and
                                    4              Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, and
                                    5              many ships were torpedoed and sunk, often within
                                    6              sight of civilians on shore, including 52 tankers sunk
                                    7              between January and March 1942.
                                    8                        (7) At that time General George Marshall re-
                                    9              marked that ‘‘[t]he losses by submarines off our At-
                                  10               lantic seaboard and in the Caribbean now threaten
                                  11               our entire war effort’’.
                                  12                         (8) From the beginning CAP leaders urged the
                                  13               military to use its services to patrol coastal waters
                                  14               but met with great resistance because of the non-
                                  15               military status of CAP civilian pilots.
                                  16                         (9) Finally, in response to the ever-increasing
                                  17               submarine attacks, the Tanker Committee of the Pe-
                                  18               troleum Industry War Council urged the Navy De-
                                  19               partment and the War Department to consider the
                                  20               use of the CAP to help patrol the sea lanes off the
                                  21               coasts of the United States.
                                  22                         (10) While the Navy initially rejected this sug-
                                  23               gestion, the Army decided it had merit, and the Civil
                                  24               Air Patrol Coastal Patrol began in March 1942.

                                    1                        (11) Oil companies and other organizations pro-
                                    2              vided funds to help pay for some CAP operations,
                                    3              including vitally needed shore radios that were used
                                    4              to monitor patrol missions.
                                    5                        (12) By late March 1942, the Navy also began
                                    6              to use the services of the CAP.

                                  12                         (14) Within 15 minutes of starting his patrol
                                  13               on the first Coastal Patrol flight, a pilot had sighted

                                    3                        (17) Most of these aircraft were painted in

                                    5              and carried special markings (a blue circle with a
                                    6              white triangle) to identify them as CAP aircraft.
                                    7                        (18) Patrols were conducted up to 100 miles off

                                  12               CAP operations were conducted in bad weather as
