                                    4     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

                                    5              (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
                                    6                        (1) Congress must enact a comprehensive, def-
                                    7              icit reduction plan to solve the country’s fiscal chal-
                                    8              lenges and to promote national security, economic
                                    9              stability, and the continued growth and prosperity of
                                  10               the United States.
                                  11                         (2) The keys to a comprehensive, deficit reduc-
                                  12               tion solution are increased revenues and changes in
                                  13               mandatory spending.
                                  14                         (3) The Budget Control Act of 2011 was en-
                                  15               acted to avert a default on Federal debt obligations,
                                  16               and it reduced discretionary spending by approxi-
                                  17               mately $1 trillion through fiscal year 2021.
                                  18                         (4) Because the Joint Select Committee on Def-
                                  19               icit Reduction failed to recommend legislation pro-
                                  20               viding an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction,
                                  21               Federal law mandates that the additional savings be
                                  22               sequestered.
                                  23                         (5) Sequestration was designed as a forcing
                                  24               mechanism for an agreement on a comprehensive,




                                  25               deficit reduction plan. It has failed to produce the
                                  26               intended results.

                                    1                        (6) It no longer makes sense to rely on seques-

                                    4              omy are too great.
                                    5                        (7) Under sequestration, automatic, indiscrimi-
                                    6              nate cuts would be applied, through fiscal year

                                    8              programs to achieve $1.2 trillion in savings, fore-
                                    9              stalling the sound planning needed for prudent and

                                  14               during national strength.
                                  15                         (8) Even the prospect of sequestration is dis-
                                  16               ruptive to regular order and to the congressional ap-
                                  17               propriations process, and it fosters damaging eco-
                                  18               nomic uncertainty, while short-term solutions only
                                  19               suspend the prospect and continue to undermine the
                                  20               certainty needed for economic recovery.
                                  21                         (9) Therefore, Congress must eliminate the
                                  22               threat of sequestration.
                                  23                         (10) Given the magnitude of the Federal deficit,




                                  24               it is likely that additional cuts to discretionary

                                  10                         (12) It is recognized that a reduction of $167

                                  14               The Department of Defense is highly encouraged to
                                  15               revisit its current strategic guidance and to work
                                  16               closely with Congress in building a new National
