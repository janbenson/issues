<ul><p nid="t0:ih:1024">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:1025">(1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the U.S.S.R. no longer exists, and the Cold War is over. The nature of threats to the national security and military interests of the United States has changed. However, the United States continues to maintain an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery systems that were devised with the Cold War in mind.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1026">(2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United States includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of which are deployed at sea. Each of these submarines is armed with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1027">(3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United States will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining its nuclear force. A substantial decrease in the nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for both the budget and national security.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1028">(4) The national security interests of the United States can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as suggested by the Department of Defense&#x2019;s January 2012 strategic guidance titled &#x2018;Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense&#x2019;. Furthermore, a number of arms control, nuclear, and national security experts have urged the United States to reduce the number of deployed nuclear warheads to no more than 1,000.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1029">(5) Economic security and national security are linked and both will be well served by smart defense spending.

<ul><p nid="t0:ih:1117">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:1118">(1) The 2011 Financial Report of the United States Government found that 32 of 35 major Federal agencies received clean audit opinions. Two more, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State, received &#x2018;qualified&#x2019; audit opinions but are making progress. Only the Department of Defense had a &#x2018;disclaimer&#x2019; because it lacked any auditable reporting or accounting available for independent review.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1119">(2) The financial management of the Department of Defense has been on the &#x2018;High-Risk&#x2019; list of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO found that the Department is not consistently able to &#x2018;control costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; and prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1120">(3) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the Government Accountability Office stated that past expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 to improve financial information, and billions of dollars more of anticipated expenditures on new information technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of the Department. At that hearing, the Government Accountability Office could not predict when the Department would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1121">(4) Section 9 of article I of the Constitution of the United States requires all agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish &#x2018;a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1122">(5) Section 303(d) of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (<public-law-reference session="101" number="576">Public Law 101-576</public-law-reference>) required that financial statements be prepared and independently audited for the Department of the Army by March 31, 1992, and for the Department of the Air Force by March 31, 1993. Neither the Department of the Army nor the Department of the Air Force has complied.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1123">(6) <usc-reference title="31" section="3515" paragraph="">Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code</usc-reference>, requires the agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to present auditable financial statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The Department has not complied with this law.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1124">(7) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (<usc-reference title="31" section="3512" paragraph="">31 U.S.C. 3512</usc-reference> note) requires financial systems acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and control the cost of government.

In December 2005, that directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.</p><p nid="t0:ih:1127">(10) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<public-law-reference session="111" number="84">Public Law 111-84</public-law-reference>) requires regular status reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described in paragraph (9), and codified as a statutory requirement the goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense financial statements are validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:1128">SEC. 663.

<ul><p nid="t0:ih:1522">(a) Findings- Congress finds that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:1523">(1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of the international leadership of the United States;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1524">(2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the interstate highway system are all testaments to American ingenuity and have helped propel and maintain the United States as the world&#x2019;s largest economy;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1525">(3) according to the World Economic Forum&#x2019;s Global Competitiveness Report, the United States fell to second place in 2009, and dropped to fourth place overall in 2010, however, in the &#x2018;Quality of overall infrastructure&#x2019; category of the same report, the United States ranked twenty-third in the world;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1526">(4) according to the World Bank&#x2019;s 2010 Logistic Performance Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods and connect manufacturers and consumers with international markets is improving around the world, and the United States now ranks seventh in the world in logistics-related infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1527">(5) according to a January 2009 report from the University of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled &#x2018;Employment, Productivity and Growth,&#x2019; infrastructure investment is a &#x2018;highly effective engine of job creation&#x2019;;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1528">(6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the current condition of the infrastructure in the United States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years to bring American infrastructure up to adequate condition;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1529">(7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade the United States surface transportation system to a state of good repair and create a more advanced system;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1530">(8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large funding gaps;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1531">(9) published reports state that there may not be enough demand for municipal bonds to maintain the same level of borrowing at the same rates, resulting in significantly decreased infrastructure investment at the State and local level;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1532">(10) current funding mechanisms are not readily scalable and do not--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:1533">(A) serve large in-State or cross jurisdiction infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national significance, or projects that cross sector silos;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1534">(B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment; or</p><p nid="t0:ih:1535">(C) ensure the optimal return on public resources;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:1536">(11) although grant programs of the United States Government must continue to play a central role in financing the transportation, environment, and energy infrastructure needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands on existing Federal, State, and local funding for infrastructure expansion clearly exceed the resources to support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt serious concerns about the United States ability to sustain long-term economic development, productivity, and international competitiveness;</p><p nid="t0:ih:1537">(12) the capital markets, including pension funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other investors, have a growing interest in infrastructure investment and represent hundreds of billions of dollars of potential investment; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:1538">(13) the establishment of a United States Government-owned, independent, professionally managed institution that could provide credit support to qualified infrastructure projects of regional and national significance, making transparent merit-based investment decisions based on the commercial viability of infrastructure projects, would catalyze the participation of significant private investment capital.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:1539">(b) Purpose- The purpose of this part is to facilitate investment in, and long-term financing of, economically viable infrastructure projects of regional or national significance in a manner that both complements existing Federal, State, local, and private funding sources for these projects and introduces a merit-based system for financing such projects, in order to mobilize significant private sector investment, create jobs, and ensure United States competitiveness through an institution that limits the need for ongoing Federal funding.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:1540">SEC. 763.
