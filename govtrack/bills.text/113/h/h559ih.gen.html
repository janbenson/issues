<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">The purposes of this Act are as follows:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) To strengthen American national security by ensuring that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:18">(A) military planning, operations, weapons development, and a long-term national security strategy are connected to sound financial controls; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(B) defense dollars are spent efficiently.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:20">(2) To instill a culture of accountability at the Department of Defense that supports the vast majority of dedicated members of the Armed Forces and civilians who want to ensure proper accounting and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:21">SEC. 3. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:22">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:23">(1) The 2012 Financial Report of the United States Government found that 21 of 24 major Federal agencies received clean audit opinions. Two more, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State, received &#x2018;qualified&#x2019; audit opinions but are making progress. Only the Department of Defense had a &#x2018;disclaimer&#x2019; because it lacked any auditable reporting or accounting available for independent review. In the Financial Report, the Treasury Department summarized: &#x2018;Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of Federal agencies have initiated and sustained disciplined and consistent financial reporting operations, implemented effective internal controls around financial reporting, and have successfully integrated transaction processing and accounting records. These efforts have resulted in improved results on financial statement audits. However, weaknesses in basic financial management practices and other limitations continue to prevent one major agency, and the Government as a whole, from achieving an audit opinion.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(2) The financial management of the Department of Defense has been on the &#x2018;High-Risk&#x2019; list of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO found that the Department is not consistently able to &#x2018;control costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; and prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">(3) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the Government Accountability Office stated that past expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 to improve financial information, and billions of dollars more of anticipated expenditures on new information technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of the Department. At that hearing, the Government Accountability Office could not predict when the Department would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(4) Section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States requires all agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish &#x2018;a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(5) Section 303(d) of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (<public-law-reference session="101" number="576">Public Law 101-576</public-law-reference>) required that financial statements be prepared and independently audited for the Department of the Army by March 31, 1992, and for the Department of the Air Force by March 31, 1993. Neither the Department of the Army nor the Department of the Air Force has complied.</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">(6) <usc-reference title="31" section="3515" paragraph="">Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code</usc-reference>, requires the agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to present auditable financial statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The Department has not complied with this law.</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">(7) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (<usc-reference title="31" section="3512" paragraph="">31 U.S.C. 3512</usc-reference> note) requires financial systems acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and control the cost of government. The Department has not complied with this law.</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">(8) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (<public-law-reference session="107" number="107">Public Law 107-107</public-law-reference>) requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress annually on the reliability of the financial statements of the Department of Defense, to minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial management policies, procedures, and internal controls.</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">(9) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), to improve Department business processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and accurate financial information that could generate an audit-ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(10) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<public-law-reference session="111" number="84">Public Law 111-84</public-law-reference>) requires regular status reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described in paragraph (9), and codified as a statutory requirement the goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense financial statements are validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:33">SEC. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:50">It is the sense of Congress that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:51">(1) as the overall defense budget is cut, congressional defense committees and the Department of Defense should not endanger the Nation&#x2019;s troops by reducing wounded warrior accounts or vital protection (such as body armor) for members of the Armed Forces in harm&#x2019;s way;</p><p nid="t0:ih:52">(2) the valuation of legacy assets by the Department of Defense should be simplified without compromising essential controls or generally accepted government auditing standards; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:53">(3) nothing in this Act should be construed to require or permit the declassification of accounting details about classified defense programs, and, as required by law, the Department of Defense should ensure financial accountability in such programs using proven practices, including using auditors with security clearances.</p></ul></ul></body>
