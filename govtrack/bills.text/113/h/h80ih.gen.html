<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90 percent for White women and 78 percent for African-American women.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) Early detection for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by Hispanic women.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(8) Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer which affects women under the age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">(9) African-American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than White women.</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(10) Triple-negative breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than most other types of breast cancer.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(11) Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">(12) Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer is the key to survival because the tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that target these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, early detection and education is vital.</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">(13) Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:30">(A) the rates of prevalence and incidence of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American, Hispanic, and other minority women;</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">(B) he costs associated with treating triple-negative breast cancer; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(C) the methods by which triple-negative breast cancer may be prevented or cured in these women.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:33">SEC. 3.
