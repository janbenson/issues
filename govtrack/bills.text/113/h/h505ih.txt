                                    8     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.
                                    9              Congress finds the following:
                                  10                         (1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the U.S.S.R.
                                  11               no longer exists, and the Cold War is over. The na-
                                  12               ture of threats to the national security and military
                                  13               interests of the United States has changed. How-
                                  14               ever, the United States continues to maintain an
                                  15               enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery
                                  16               systems that were devised with the Cold War in
                                  17               mind.
                                  18                         (2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United
                                  19               States includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear
                                  20               warheads, of which approximately 2,000 are de-
                                  21               ployed with three delivery components: long-range
                                  22               strategic bomber aircraft, land-based interconti-

                                  24               ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United
                                  25               States comprises 93 B–52 and 20 B–2 aircraft. The

                                    1              United States maintains 450 intercontinental bal-
                                    2              listic missiles. The United States also maintains 14
                                    3              Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of which are de-
                                    4              ployed at sea. Each of these submarines is armed
                                    5              with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear war-
                                    6              heads.
                                    7                        (3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear
                                    8              security comes at significant cost. Over the next 10
                                    9              years, the United States will spend hundreds of bil-
                                  10               lions of dollars maintaining its nuclear force. A sub-
                                  11               stantial decrease in the nuclear arsenal of the
                                  12               United States is prudent for both the budget and
                                  13               national security.
                                  14                         (4) The national security interests of the
                                  15               United States can be well served by reducing the
                                  16               total number of deployed nuclear warheads and their
                                  17               delivery systems, as suggested by the Department of
