<p>To assess the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to require further negotiation of certain provisions of the NAFTA, and to provide for the withdrawal from the NAFTA unless certain conditions are met.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;NAFTA Accountability Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>(1) RISING DEFICITS IN UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS- One of the purposes of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as stated in the preamble, is to &#8216;create an expanded and secure market&#8217; for goods and services. Instead, the NAFTA has resulted in a spiraling United States trade deficit with Mexico and Canada that exceeded $93,000,000,000 in 2010, and more than $1,300,000,000,000 since the agreement&#8217;s inception. Rather than continuous development and expansion as envisioned and growing trade surpluses for the United States, the NAFTA has resulted in United States job losses and escalating trade deficits.</p><p>(2) EROSION OF THE UNITED STATES MANUFACTURING BASE- One of the purposes of the NAFTA is to enhance the competitiveness of firms in the global market. However, rather than increase the ability of the manufacturing sector in the United States to compete in the world market, the NAFTA has facilitated and accelerated the outsourcing of United States manufacturing facilities and jobs to lower-wage Mexico. Conservatively, NAFTA has led to nearly 1,000,000 American job losses. Conversely, Mexico has become an export platform displacing United States production. An unprecedented flood of imports of manufactured and agricultural goods now enter the United States. Further, Mexico has experienced an outsourcing of productivity to even lower-wage China, as Chinese imports to Mexico have grown and are imported into the United States.</p><p>(3) NAFTA SHOULD NOT BE EXPANDED- The Congress approved the NAFTA in order to achieve economic, social, and environmental benefits for the people of the United States. Based on currently available information, the goals and objectives of the NAFTA are not being achieved. Therefore, the NAFTA should not be expanded to include any other country.</p><p>(4) NAFTA TO BE RENEGOTIATED AND BENEFITS CERTIFIED- Based on the experience with the NAFTA since its implementation, it has become evident that further negotiation is required to resolve fundamental inadequacies within the NAFTA with respect to trade balances, currency differentials, health and environmental conditions, agricultural provisions, systems of justice, and illegal immigration. If the NAFTA is to continue, Congress must require certification of specific measures of economic, social, legal, and environmental progress. Otherwise Congress has no choice but to withdraw its approval of the NAFTA.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE NAFTA.</h3>
