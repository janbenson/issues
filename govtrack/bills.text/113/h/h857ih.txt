                                    2              (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
                                    3                        (1) On August 2, 2011, the President signed
                                    4              into law S. 365, the Budget Control Act of 2011,
                                    5              which reduced defense discretionary spending by
                                    6              $478 billion over ten years.
                                    7                        (2) The Budget Control Act of 2011 also estab-
                                    8              lished a sequestration in the event that a Joint Se-
                                    9              lect Committee on Deficit Reduction could not agree
                                  10               on an additional $1.2 trillion in savings by Novem-
                                  11               ber 2011.
                                  12                         (3) The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Re-
                                  13               duction was unable to reach an agreement, which
                                  14               triggered sequestration, resulting in an additional
                                  15               $495 billion reduction in defense spending over the
                                  16               same ten-year period.
                                  17                         (4) If these reductions in defense spending re-
                                  18               main intact, the total portion of defense spending as
                                  19               a percentage of the total U.S. budget will be at its
                                  20               lowest point since before World War II.
                                  21                         (5) Sequestration alone would reduce our mili-
                                  22               tary force to its smallest level since 1940, resulting
                                  23               in the separation of more than 100,000 soldiers,
                                  24               sailors, Marines, and airmen.





                                  25                         (6) Since 2009, the number of troops has more
                                  26               than doubled in Afghanistan from 30,000 to 66,000

                                    1              today. During the same period, Congress has ac-
                                    2              tively reduced the budget for the Department of De-

                                    4              (b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to:
                                    5                        (1) Avoid deeper, irresponsible defense cuts in
                                    6              the face of an increasingly dangerous world that un-
                                    7              necessarily threaten our national security and will
                                    8              cost American lives in armed conflict abroad.
                                    9                        (2) Invest in advanced military technology in
                                  10               order to equip the U.S. military with the best re-
                                  11               sources available to defend our country.
                                  12                         (3) Not allow the strategy of the U.S. military
                                  13               to be driven by budget constraints, which is unac-
                                  14               ceptable. The strategy should drive the budget.
                                  15               Avoiding cuts while our troops are at war allows
                                  16               necessary time to adjust strategy for the restruc-
                                  17               tured force post-Afghanistan. Before the House

                                  19               Chiefs General Dempsey testified ‘‘If you want [your
                                  20               military] to be doing what it’s doing today, then we
                                  21               can’t give you another dollar.’’.
                                  22                         (4) Ensure that the U.S. military forces are

                                    4              if left unchecked, will cost American lives. The hol-
                                    5              low force experienced during the Korean War would

                                    7                        (5) Halt irresponsible budget cuts because no
                                    8              amount of savings can justify the loss of one Amer-
