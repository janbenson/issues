                                    3                        (1) Private sector business concerns, which are
                                    4              free to respond to the private or public demands of
                                    5              the marketplace, constitute the strength of the
                                    6              United States economic system.
                                    7                        (2) Competitive private enterprises are the most
                                    8              productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods

                                  11               private sector of the economy is detrimental to the

                                  13                         (4) Unfair Government competition with the
                                  14               private sector of the economy is at an unacceptably
                                  15               high level, both in scope and in dollar volume.

                                  17               dress adequately the problem of unfair Government
                                  18               competition with the private sector of the economy.

                                  20               Government establish a consistent policy to rely on
                                  21               the private sector of the economy to provide goods

                                  10               (a) POLICY.—In the process of governing, the Fed-
                                  11 eral Government should not compete with its citizens. The
                                  12 competitive enterprise system, characterized by individual
                                  13 freedom and initiative, is the primary source of national
                                  14 economic strength. In recognition of this principle, it has
                                  15 been and continues to be the general policy of the Federal
                                  16 Government—
                                  17                         (1) to rely on commercial sources to supply the
                                  18               products and services the Government needs;
                                  19                         (2) to refrain from providing a product or serv-
                                  20               ice if the product or service can be procured more
                                  21               economically from a commercial source; and
                                  22                         (3) to utilize Federal employees to perform in-
