<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, killing more non-smokers than any other cancer.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Every year, more than 140,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 Americans will die from it.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy allows for the detection and removal of polyps, or abnormal growths, that could become cancerous, as well as for the early detection of colorectal cancer when treatment can be most effective.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) If all precancerous polyps were identified and removed before becoming cancerous, estimates show the number of new colorectal cancer cases could be reduced by 76 to 90 percent and deaths could be reduced by 70 to 90 percent.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) Although colorectal cancer is largely preventable, one in three adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with recommended colorectal cancer screening.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) Two-thirds of colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in patients over the age of 65.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy is a highly effective preventive service, and removing financial barriers can help to increase rates of screening.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:24">SEC. 3.
