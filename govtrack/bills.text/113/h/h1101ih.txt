                                  To strengthen America’s financial infrastructure, by requiring pre-funding
                                      for catastrophe losses using private insurance premium dollars to better
                                      prepare and protect homeowners from natural catastrophes and to protect
                                      taxpayers from massive bailouts, and to provide dedicated funding from
                                      insurance premiums to improve catastrophe preparedness, loss prevention
                                      and mitigation, and to improve the availability and affordability of private
                                      market homeowners insurance coverage for catastrophic events, and for
                                      other purposes.

                                    9              (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:
                                  10                         (1) The economy of the United States, the
                                  11               American taxpayers, and all homeowners need to be
                                  12               better prepared for, and more protected from, major
                                  13               natural catastrophes.
                                  14                         (2) Taking into consideration the current eco-
                                  15               nomic and fiscal challenges facing the United States,

                                  17               tion’s financial infrastructure to be fully prepared

                                                                                             3
                                    1              for major natural catastrophes and to mitigate the
                                    2              risk of catastrophe as much as possible.
                                    3                        (3) When major catastrophes hit, the Federal
                                    4              Government is called upon to provide significant
                                    5              funding and services to support recovery.
                                    6                        (4) The costs of post-catastrophe Federal ‘‘bail-
                                    7              outs’’ are borne by all taxpayers and can create a
                                    8              disincentive to fully prepare for catastrophes.
                                    9                        (5) Historically, the budget for Federal Govern-
                                  10               ment has assumed there will be no natural catas-
                                  11               trophes, and this lack of pre-funding for catas-
                                  12               trophes contributed substantially to annual budget
                                  13               deficits and growing national debt.
                                  14                         (6) The Budget Control Act of 2011 ends an
                                  15               era of unbudgeted recovery assistance and author-
                                  16               izes a fixed level of annual funding for catastrophes
                                  17               relief.
                                  18                         (7) The amount of future catastrophe relief
                                  19               funding is capped at the average amount spent on
                                  20               natural catastrophes during the previous 10 years
                                  21               with the high and low years removed.
                                  22                         (8) By removing the high and low years, the
                                  23               law now caps catastrophes spending at a level that




                                  24               is less than 60 percent of the amount spent on ca-
                                  25               tastrophe relief during the previous 10 years.

                                    2              ing is a top congressional priority, especially in light
                                    3              of the unprecedented fiscal challenges facing the Na-

                                    5                        (10) Natural catastrophes will continue to
                                    6              occur, and the exposure to catastrophe risk is grow-
                                    7              ing. Scientists warn that future catastrophes will in-
                                    8              evitably cause losses far in excess of prior events,
                                    9              and these losses could exceed the limited capacity in
                                  10               the private market to cover claims and remain viable
                                  11               to insure properties after massive catastrophic
                                  12               events.
                                  13                         (11) In 2011, the earthquake centered in Vir-
                                  14               ginia that shook the East Coast and the extreme
                                  15               weather and deadly super tornadoes that ripped
                                  16               across the country provided powerful reminders that
                                  17               natural catastrophes can strike unexpectedly, se-
                                  18               verely damaging areas not thought to be at high
                                  19               risk, and no region is immune from the threat of
                                  20               natural catastrophe.
                                  21                         (12) In 2012, the devastation caused by
                                  22               Superstorm Sandy demonstrated yet again the need
                                  23               for a mechanism to ensure that privately funded




                                  24               monies will be available if needed following mega-ca-
