FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Research conclusively shows that children&#8217;s experiences in the early years of life influence the developing brain and have a significant and lasting impact upon their ability to succeed in school and in life.</p><p>(2) All children deserve access to high-quality early childhood education programs that support their social, emotional, and cognitive development and help prepare them to enter school ready to learn.</p><p>(3) Research conclusively shows that high-quality early childhood education programs lead to an increase in positive outcomes for children in multiple arenas, including--</p><ul><p>(A) improved socialization skills;</p><p>(B) higher early reading and early mathematics skills;</p><p>(C) decreased grade retention;</p><p>(D) decreased special education or remedial education services, or both;</p><p>(E) decreased involvement with the juvenile justice system;</p><p>(F) increased likelihood that children will graduate from high school; and</p><p>(G) increased likelihood of employment, thus helping support America&#8217;s long-term national economic strength.</p></ul><p>(4) High-quality early childhood education programs provide parents the means to work and be financially responsible for their families.</p><p>(5) Research conclusively shows the cost-effectiveness of investments in high-quality early childhood education programs, with cost savings ranging from $7 to $17 for every dollar invested.</p><p>(6) Aligning and connecting Federal and State early education efforts with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is critical to establishing quality care and learning opportunities for children, beginning at birth and continuing through adulthood, thereby closing the achievement gap, and improving high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates.</p><p>(7) Utilizing existing partnerships, as well as instituting new partnerships, between high-quality early childhood education programs, particularly in high-need communities, and elementary schools will provide opportunities for meaningful transitions for children and result in a successful elementary and secondary education experience.</p><p>(8) Under section 1112(b)(1)(K) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6312(b)(1)(K)), local educational agencies may, but are not required to, support preschool-age and younger children through direct services or subcontracts with Head Start or other early childhood programs, but more effort is required to ensure that early learning programs and elementary schools are meeting the educational needs of young children.</p><p>(9) There is widespread acknowledgment among experts on child education that prior to entrance in kindergarten, and in the early grades, children remain on a path of development that requires attention to and support for their emotional, social, and physical development and their creativity, curiosity and tenacity.</p><p>(10) Better alignment between early childhood education programs and elementary schools, and greater support for elementary school leadership in instituting more developmentally appropriate and comprehensive learning approaches for young children, are widely acknowledged within the education community as areas ripe for improvement that would lead to better outcomes for children.</p><p>(11) Through several laws enacted in the past 2 decades, Congress has signified its interest in ensuring that young children&#8217;s learning opportunities are enhanced by requiring States to develop and implement guidelines and standards to support developmentally appropriate instruction across comprehensive domains of learning.</p></ul></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE I--IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED</p></center></h4>
