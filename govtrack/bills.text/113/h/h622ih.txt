                                    2              ducted a suitability and feasibility study of North
                                    3              Field on the island of Tinian, Commonwealth of the
                                    4              Northern Mariana Islands, for inclusion in the Na-
                                    5              tional Park System.

                                    7              Register of Historic Places as an historic district
                                    8              and has been designated a national historic land-
                                  109              mark.     (3) The Department of Defense holds a 50-year

                                  13               North Field Tinian was suitable for inclusion as
                                  14               ‘‘one of the most significant World War II sites in
                                  15               the Pacific’’ because atomic bombs were flown to
                                  16               Hiroshima and Nagasaki from this site.

                                  18               however, that it was not feasible to include North

                                  20               because of the ‘‘military’s future long term needs’’.
