113TH CONGRESS
   1ST SESSION       H. R. 444
                    AN ACT
To require that, if the President’s fiscal year 2014 budget
   does not achieve balance in a fiscal year covered by
   such budget, the President shall submit a supplemental
   unified budget by April 1, 2013, which identifies a fiscal
   year in which balance is achieved, and for other pur-
   poses.
                                2
 1       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
 2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 3   SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 4       This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Require Presidential
 5 Leadership and No Deficit Act’’ or the ‘‘Require a PLAN
 6 Act’’.
 7   SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

 8       (a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to require
 9 the President to submit to Congress a supplemental uni-
10 fied budget if the President’s budget for fiscal year 2014
11 does not achieve balance in a fiscal year covered by such
12 budget.
13       (b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
14              (1) With this year’s expected failure to meet the
15       statutory deadline for submission of his budget, as
16       stated by the Office of Management and Budget, the
17       President will have only met the statutory deadline
18       in one of his five budget submissions.
19              (2) Despite a promise to cut the deficit in half,
20       the deficit doubled during the President’s first year
21       in office and has exceeded $1 trillion for four years
22       now.
23              (3) Since taking office, the President has al-
24       lowed the Federal debt to grow by nearly $6 trillion




      •HR 444 EH               3
 1       and total debt now exceeds the size of the entire
 2       economy of the United States.
 3             (4) Under the President’s most recent budget
 4       submission, the budget never achieves balance.
 5             (5) The President’s fiscal year 2013 budget
 6       submission includes the admission that under his
 7       own policies the Federal Government’s ‘‘fiscal posi-
 8       tion gradually deteriorates’’.
 9   SEC. 3. SUBMISSION OF A SUPPLEMENTAL UNIFIED BUDG-
10                 ET.
11       (a) IN GENERAL.—If the President’s budget for fis-
12 cal year 2014, submitted to Congress pursuant to section
13 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, results in a pro-
14 jected deficit in every fiscal year for which estimates are
15 provided in such budget, then the President shall submit
16 a supplemental unified budget pursuant to subsection (b).
17       (b) CONTENTS     OF    SUPPLEMENTAL UNIFIED BUDG-
18   ET.—Not   later than April 1, 2013, the President shall

20 cludes—

22       1105(a) of title 31, United States Code;
23             (2) an estimate of the earliest fiscal year in
24       which the supplemental budget is not projected to
25       result in a deficit;


      •HR 444 EH            4
1            (3) a detailed description of additional policies
2       to be implemented in order to achieve such result
3       (including an evaluation of duplicative agency func-
4       tions and agency effectiveness, and proposals for
5       consolidating duplicative functions and programs be-
6       tween agencies in the interests of cost-savings);
7            (4) an explanation of the differences between
8       the President’s budget for fiscal year 2014 and the
9       supplemental unified budget referred to in this sub-
10      section;
11           (5) an estimate of the cost per taxpayer of the
12      annual deficit for each year in which the supple-
13      mental unified budget is projected to result in a def-
14      icit; and
15           (6) under a separate heading entitled ‘‘Direct
16      Spending’’, which shall include a category for
17      ‘‘Means-Tested Direct Spending’’ and a category for
18      ‘‘Nonmeans-Tested     Direct   Spending’’   and     sets
19      forth—
20                  (A) the average rate of growth for each
21           category in the total amount of outlays during
22           the 10-year period preceding the budget year;
23                  (B) information on the budget proposals
24           for reform of such programs;




     •HR 444 EH             5
 1                 (C) a description of programs which shall
 2            be considered means-tested direct spending and
 3            nonmeans-tested direct spending for purposes
 4            of this paragraph; and
 5                 (D) an annual estimate of the total
 6            amount of outlays for each such program for
 7            the period covered by the budget proposal.
 8       (c) DEFINITION.—The term ‘‘unified budget’’ means
 9 the total level of outlays, total level of receipts, and the
10 resulting deficit or surplus of the United States Govern-
11 ment for a fiscal year.
