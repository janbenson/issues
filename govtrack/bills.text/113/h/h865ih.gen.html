<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">The Congress finds that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) the African Burial Ground National Historic Landmark in New York, New York, holds the remains of up to 20,000 enslaved Africans and early-generation African-Americans from the colonial era;</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) the Africans and African-Americans that suffered under slavery show us the strength of the human character and provide us with a model of courage, commitment, and perseverance;</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) as President George W. Bush stated on July 8, 2003, during his remarks at Goree Island, Senegal: &#x2018;For 250 years the captives endured an assault on their culture and their dignity. The spirit of Africans in America did not break. . . . All the generations of oppression under the laws of man could not crush the hope of freedom and defeat the purposes of God.&#x2019;;</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) on February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush established the National Monument, which was comprised of the approximately 15,000-square-foot parcel of the National Historic Landmark that was bounded by Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan;</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) an international memorial museum facility dedicated to those individuals who suffered the grave injustice of slavery in the United States, while at the same time helping to build the country, would--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:22">(A) reflect the significance of the African Burial Ground; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(B) help the people of the United States understand the past and honor the history of all people in the United States;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:24">(6) in 1998, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:25">(A) stated that the African Burial Ground affords the perfect opportunity to gain insight into--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:26">(i) the institution of slavery, as practiced in urban, rural, northern, and southern parts of the United States; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(ii) the international slave trade; and</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:28">(B) proposed that a partnership be formed among the Smithsonian, the National Park Service, and the General Services Administration to further develop the African Burial Ground;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:29">(7) the National Museum of African American History and Culture Act (<usc-reference title="20" section="80r" paragraph="">20 U.S.C. 80r</usc-reference> et seq.), which authorized construction of a museum in Washington, DC, identified the period of slavery as one of the periods of the African-American diaspora that would be encompassed by the museum;</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">(8) the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:31">(A) is unlike any other anthropological and symbolic site in the United States or the world;</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(B) includes DNA samples from the remarkably well-preserved human remains that will enable researchers to trace the home &#x2018;roots&#x2019; in Africa of those individuals buried at the African Burial Ground; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:33">(C) provides a fitting location for a national memorial facility, relating to the National Museum of African American History and Culture that would--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:34">(i) pay special tribute to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:35">(I) the thousands of enslaved individuals who are buried at the African Burial Ground; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:36">(II) all of the individuals who were enslaved during the history of the United States;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:37">(ii) examine the African cultural traditions brought to the United States by the enslaved; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:38">(iii) explore in-depth the institution of slavery;</p></ul></ul><p nid="t0:ih:39">(9) a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:40">(A) was first recommended by a Federal steering committee in 1992; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:41">(B) in conjunction with the planned World Trade Center memorial and other nearby sites, would attract millions of visitors from the United States and abroad, making a substantial contribution to the development and revitalization of Lower Manhattan in response to the attacks on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:42">(10) <public-law-reference session="99" number="511">Public Law 99-511</public-law-reference> (100 Stat. 2080) encouraged support for the establishment of a commemorative structure within the National Park System or on other Federal land that is dedicated to the promotion of understanding, knowledge, opportunity, and equality for all people;</p><p nid="t0:ih:43">(11) similar to the National Museum of the Native American that was established by section 3(a) of the National Museum of the American Indian Act (<usc-reference title="20" section="80q-1" paragraph="a">20 U.S.C. 80q-1(a)</usc-reference>), a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground would benefit from a partnership among--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:44">(A) the Federal Government;</p><p nid="t0:ih:45">(B) the State of New York;</p><p nid="t0:ih:46">(C) the city of New York; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:47">(D) members of the private sector;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:48">(12) the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:49">(A) has been determined to be nationally significant as--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:50">(i) a National Historic Landmark; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:51">(ii) a National Monument; and</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:52">(B) provides an important opportunity for interpretation, understanding, partnership and pride; and</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:53">(13) the National Park Service--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:54">(A) has played an important role in the development of the African Burial Ground (including the designation of the African Burial Ground as a National Monument);</p><p nid="t0:ih:55">(B) successfully operates other national facilities in the city of New York that symbolize freedom and the quest for freedom in America, including--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:56">(i) the Statue of Liberty National Monument; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:57">(ii) Ellis Island National Monument;</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:58">(C) provided key support to the Presidential Study Commission for the National Museum of African American History and Culture; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:59">(D) is well-suited to assume a leadership role with respect to the creation of the Museum.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:60">SEC. 3.
