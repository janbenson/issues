Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion.</p><p>(4) REPORTS AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES- No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to--</p><ul><p>(A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary&#8217;s duties under this chapter; and</p><p>(B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.</p></ul></ul><p>(g) RECORDS- A recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records that fully disclose--</p><ul><p>(1) the amount and the disposition by the recipient of the proceeds of the assistance;</p><p>(2) the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which the assistance is given or used; and</p><p>(3) the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.</p></ul><p>(h) ACCESS TO RECORDS- The Secretary, and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this chapter.</p><p>(i) PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION- With respect to property acquired or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on the basis of residence.</p><p>(j) COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES- To ensure consistency in policies and actions under this chapter with other related Federal programs and activities and to ensure coordination of the planning, acquisition, and development assistance to States under this section with other related Federal programs and activities--</p><ul><p>(1) the President may issue such regulations with respect thereto as the President considers desirable; and</p><p>(2) the assistance may be provided only in accordance with the regulations.</p></ul><p>(k) CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND OTHER PROJECTS TO REDUCE CRIME-</p><ul><p>(1) AVAILABILITY AND PURPOSE OF FUNDS- In addition to assistance for planning projects, and in addition to the projects identified in subsection (e), and from amounts appropriated out of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to the States, not to exceed $15,000,000, for projects or combinations thereof for the purpose of making capital improvements and other measures to increase safety in urban parks and recreation areas, including funds to--</p><ul><p>(A) increase lighting within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas;</p><p>(B) provide emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement or security personnel in areas within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas;</p><p>(C) increase security personnel within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas; and</p><p>(D) fund any other project intended to increase the security and safety of public parks and recreation areas.</p></ul><p>(2) ELIGIBILITY- In addition to the requirements for project approval imposed by this section, eligibility for assistance under this subsection shall depend on a showing of need.
