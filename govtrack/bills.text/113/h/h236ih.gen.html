In the case of a suspension or revocation of a license, the Attorney General shall, on the request of the holder of the license, stay the effective date of the suspension or revocation.

The aggrieved party may at any time within 60 days after the date notice is given under this paragraph file a petition with the United States district court for the district in which party resides or in which the party&#x2019;s principal place of business is located for a de novo judicial review of the denial, suspension, revocation, or assessment. In a proceeding conducted under this subsection, the court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties to the proceeding whether or not such evidence was considered at the hearing held under paragraph (2). If the court decides that the Attorney General was not authorized to deny the application or to suspend or revoke the license or to assess the civil penalty, the court shall order the Attorney General to take such action as may be necessary to comply with the judgment of the court.&#x2019;.</p></blockquote></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:27">SEC. 6.
