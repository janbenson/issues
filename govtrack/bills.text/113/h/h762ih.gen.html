<ul><p nid="t0:ih:18">Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:19">(1) The application of numerous and significant variations in State law and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health insurance coverage.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(2) Mandates for health care coverage established by title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will significantly elevate health insurance costs beyond State and Federal ability to pay.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(3) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate commerce.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(4) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by the States in regulating this coverage.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(5) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided a successful model for the sale of insurance across State lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single State.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:24">SEC. 4.
