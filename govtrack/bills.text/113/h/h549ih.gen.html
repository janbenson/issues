<p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:17">SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:18">The Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:19">(1) Rising costs resulting from natural disasters are placing an increasing strain on the ability of property and casualty insurance companies to assure payment of homeowners&#x2019; claims and other insurance claims arising from major natural disasters now and in the future.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(2) Present tax laws do not provide adequate incentives to assure that natural disaster insurance is provided or, where such insurance is provided, that funds are available for payment of insurance claims in the event of future catastrophic losses from major natural disasters, as present law requires an insurer wishing to accumulate surplus assets for this purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax retained earnings.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(3) Revising the tax laws applicable to the property and casualty insurance industry to permit carefully controlled accumulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds devoted solely to the payment of claims arising from future major natural disasters will provide incentives for property and casualty insurers to make natural disaster insurance available, will give greater protection to the Nation&#x2019;s homeowners, small businesses, and other insurance consumers, and will help assure the future financial health of the Nation&#x2019;s insurance system as a whole.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(4) Implementing these changes will reduce the possibility that a significant portion of the private insurance system would fail in the wake of a major natural disaster and that governmental entities would be required to step in to provide relief at taxpayer expense.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:23">SEC. 3.
