                                  15               Israel’s qualitative military edge, including its ad-
                                  16               vantage over non-state actors such as Hezbollah and
                                  17               Hamas, which boast increasingly sophisticated and

                                  22               a success rate of more than 85 percent, intercepting

                                  10               own vital national security interests and the cause of
                                  11               Middle Eastern peace and stability by supporting

                                  15               the technology of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense

                                  19                         (7) The Government of Israel currently has five
                                  20               operational Iron Dome batteries deployed in the
                                  21               field, which are far from sufficient to protect all of
