                                     1ST SESSION                          H. R. 911
                                        To restore the application of the Federal antitrust laws to the business

                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                                      FEBRUARY 28, 2013

                                                                         on the Judiciary




                                                                            A BILL
                                  To restore the application of the Federal antitrust laws to
                                     the business of health insurance to protect competition
                                     and consumers.
                                    1              Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
                                    2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
                                    3     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Competitive Health
                                    5 Insurance Reform Act of 2013’’.
                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              The Congress finds the following:
                                    8
                                                             (1) Open, free, and fair competition has made
                                    9              the United States the strongest economy in the
                                  10               world.

                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (2) As a general proposition, Government
                                    2              should ensure that no industry obtains an unfair
                                    3              competitive advantage and that the playing field is
                                    4              equal. The Congress should not play favorites with
                                    5              certain industries or special interest groups by ex-
                                    6              empting one group from the general application of
                                    7              the law.
                                    8                        (3) There is no factual basis supporting any
                                    9              further exemption of the health insurance industry
                                  10               from Federal antitrust and unfair competition laws.
                                  11                         (4) Enforcement of these laws is most appro-
                                  12               priately done through the U.S. Department of Jus-
                                  13               tice, and in the case of aggrieved individuals through
                                  14               private actions as set forth in the existing statutes.
                                  15      SEC. 3. PURPOSE.
                                  16               It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that health
                                  17 insurance issuers are subject to the same antitrust and
                                  18 unfair trade practices laws that all businesses have had
                                  19 to comply with and to more effectively ensure that these
                                  20 issuers would be subject to Federal laws against price fix-
                                  21 ing, bid rigging, or market allocations to the detriment
                                  22 of competition and consumers. This Act remedies a special
                                  23 exemption provided by Congress in 1945 to respond to the




                                  24 United States Supreme Court decision entitled United
                                  25 States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, where-

                                    1 in the Court correctly held that the Federal Government
                                    2 could regulate insurance companies under the authority
                                    3 of the commerce clause in the Constitution. This Act
                                    4 would also retain enforcement of these laws with State and
                                    5 Federal law enforcement agencies and allow private causes
                                    6 of action by aggrieved consumers harmed by unfair trade
                                    7 practices.

                                  10               (a) AMENDMENT                    TO       MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT.—
                                  11 Section 3 of the Act of March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1013),
                                  12 commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act, is
                                  13 amended by adding at the end the following:
                                  14               ‘‘(c)(1) Nothing contained in this Act shall modify,

                                  18 of the preceding sentence, the term ‘antitrust laws’ has
                                  19 the meaning given it in subsection (a) of the first section
                                  20 of the Clayton Act, except that such term includes section
                                  21 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to the extent that
                                  22 such section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition.
