<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">The Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Since 2007, there has been a nearly 20-percent drop in the number of 18-year-olds with bank accounts, and in 2012, nearly one in three Americans don&#x2019;t pay their bills on time.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Ninety percent of Americans believe all high school students should be required to take a class in financial education.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) Eighty percent of parents believe schools are teaching money management and budgeting, while over 70 percent of teachers are not teaching financial literacy.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) According to a 2010 survey, only a few States have adopted varying degrees of financial literacy curriculum, and only four States require high school students to take a semester long course.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) Two in five U.S. adults gave themselves a C, D or F on their knowledge of personal finance. In 2011, 76 percent admitted they could benefit from additional advice and answers to everyday financial questions from a professional.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) Two in five adults indicated that they are now saving less than they were one year ago.</p><p nid="t0:ih:23">(7) Most adults feel that their financial literacy skills are inadequate, yet they do not rely on anyone else to handle their finances; they feel it is important to know more but have received no financial education.</p><p nid="t0:ih:24">(8) It is necessary to respond immediately to the pressing needs of individuals faced with the loss of their financial stability, however increased attention must also be paid to financial literacy education reform and long-term solutions to prevent future personal financial disasters.</p><p nid="t0:ih:25">(9) There is an urgent need to respond to the economic recovery with research-based financial literacy education programs to reach individuals at all ages and socioeconomic levels, particularly those facing unique and challenging financial situations, such as high school graduates entering the workforce, soon-to-be and recent college graduates, young families, and the unique needs of military personnel and their families.</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(10) More than 70 percent of parents say they have spoken with their teens about credit and using credit cards wisely, while less than 44 percent of the teenaged children of those respondents say their parents have talked to them about credit cards.</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(11) Seventy-six percent of parents surveyed said their high school student does not have a budget.</p><p nid="t0:ih:28">(12) Seventy-five percent of 16 to 18-year-olds say learning more about budgeting and money management is one of their top priorities. Researchers document a &#x2018;snowball effect&#x2019; that such early efforts exponentially increase the likelihood that students will pursue more financial education as time goes on.</p><p nid="t0:ih:29">(13) High school and college students who are exposed to cumulative financial education show an increase in financial knowledge, which in turn drives increasingly responsible behavior as they become young adults.</p><p nid="t0:ih:30">(14) Sixty percent of parents identify their teens as &#x2018;quick spenders&#x2019;, and most acknowledge they could do a better job of teaching and preparing kids for the financial challenges of adulthood, including budgeting, saving, and investing.</p><p nid="t0:ih:31">(15) Ninety-three percent of teens surveyed in a 2012 report say they are not involved in paying household bills or managing the household budget. Forty-six percent admit to not knowing how to create a budget.</p><p nid="t0:ih:32">(16) The majority (52 percent) of young adults between the ages of 23-28 consider &#x2018;making better choices about managing money&#x2019; the single most important issue for individual Americans to act on today.</p><p nid="t0:ih:33">(17) According to the Government Accountability Office, giving Americans the information they need to make effective financial decisions can be key to their well-being and to the country&#x2019;s economic health. The recent financial crisis, when many borrowers failed to fully understand the risks associated with certain financial products, underscored the need to improve individuals&#x2019; financial literacy and empower all Americans to make informed financial decisions. This is especially true for young people as they are earning their first paychecks, securing student aid, and establishing their financial independence. Therefore, focusing economic education and financial literacy efforts and best practices for young people between the ages of 8-24 is of utmost importance.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:34">SEC. 3.
