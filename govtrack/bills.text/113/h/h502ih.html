The Commissioner shall not disclose or release Social Security information (other than such verification or nonverification) except as provided for in this section or section 205(c)(2)(I) of the Social Security Act.</p><p>&#8216;(D) RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) As part of the verification system, the Secretary of Homeland Security (in consultation with any designee of the Secretary selected to establish and administer the verification system), shall establish a reliable, secure method, which, within the time periods specified under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3), compares the name and alien identification or authorization number which are provided in an inquiry against such information maintained by the Secretary in order to validate (or not validate) the information provided, the correspondence of the name and number, and whether the alien is authorized to be employed in the United States.</p><p>&#8216;(ii) When a single employer has submitted to the verification system pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3) the identical Social Security account number in more than one instance, or when multiple employers have submitted to the verification system pursuant to such paragraph the identical Social Security account number, in a manner which indicates the possible fraudulent use of that number, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall conduct an investigation, within the time periods specified in such subparagraphs, in order to ensure that no fraudulent use of a Social Security account number has taken place. If the Secretary has selected a designee to establish and administer the verification system, the designee shall notify the Secretary when a single employer has submitted to the verification system pursuant to such subparagraphs the identical Social Security account number in more than one instance, or when multiple employers have submitted to the verification system pursuant to such paragraph the identical Social Security account number, in a manner which indicates the possible fraudulent use of that number. The designee shall also provide the Secretary with all pertinent information, including the name and address of the employer or employers who submitted the relevant Social Security account number, the relevant Social Security account number submitted by the employer or employers, and the relevant name and date of birth of the employee submitted by the employer or employers.</p><p>&#8216;(iii) The Secretary in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall establish procedures to permit an individual who contests a tentative or final nonverification notice, or seeks to verify the individual&#8217;s own employment, to contact the appropriate agency and, in a timely manner, correct or update the information used by the system.</p><p>&#8216;(iv) The Secretary shall prescribe a system to register employer participation prior to the date the employer is required or permitted to submit information with respect to an employee.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(E) UPDATING INFORMATION- The Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall update their information in a manner that promotes the maximum accuracy and shall provide a process for the prompt correction of erroneous information, including instances in which it is brought to their attention in the secondary verification process described in paragraph (3)(C).</p><p>&#8216;(F) FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT- If an individual alleges that the individual would not have been dismissed from a job but for an error of the verification mechanism, the individual may seek compensation only through the mechanism of the Federal Tort Claims Act, and injunctive relief to correct such error. No class action may be brought under this subparagraph.</p><p>&#8216;(G) PROTECTION FROM LIABILITY FOR ACTIONS TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION- No person or entity shall be civilly or criminally liable for any action taken in good faith reliance on information provided through the employment eligibility verification mechanism established under this paragraph.&#8217;.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p>(b) Repeal of Provision Relating to Evaluations and Changes in Employment Verification- Section 274A(d) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(d)) is repealed.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.

If an individual provides a document (or combination of documents) that reasonably appears on its face to be genuine, reasonably appears to pertain to the individual whose identity and work eligibility is being verified, and is sufficient to meet the first sentence of this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the person or entity to solicit the production of any other document or as requiring the individual to produce another document.&#8217;;</p></ul></blockquote><p>(3) in subsection (b)(1)(D)--</p><ul><p>(A) in clause (i), by striking &#8216;or such other personal identification information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes of this section&#8217;; and</p><p>(B) in clause (ii), by inserting before the period &#8216;and that contains a photograph of the individual&#8217;;</p></ul><p>(4) in subsection (b)(2), by adding at the end the following: &#8216;The individual must also provide that individual&#8217;s Social Security account number (if the individual claims to have been issued such a number), and, if the individual does not attest to United States citizenship under this paragraph, such identification or authorization number established by the Department of Homeland Security for the alien as the Secretary may specify.&#8217;; and</p><p>(5) by amending paragraph (3) of subsection (b) to read as follows:</p><blockquote><p>&#8216;(3) RETENTION OF VERIFICATION FORM AND VERIFICATION-</p><ul><p>&#8216;(A) IN GENERAL- After completion of such form in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person or entity must--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) retain a paper, microfiche, microfilm, or electronic version of the form and make it available for inspection by officers of the Department of Homeland Security, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor during a period beginning on the date of the hiring, recruiting, or referral of the individual or the date of the completion of verification of a previously hired individual and ending--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(I) in the case of the recruiting or referral of an individual, 3 years after the date of the recruiting or referral;</p><p>&#8216;(II) in the case of the hiring of an individual, the later of--</p></ul></ul></ul></blockquote></ul></ul><blockquote><p>&#8216;(aa) 3 years after the date of such hiring; or</p><p>&#8216;(bb) 1 year after the date the individual&#8217;s employment is terminated; and</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><p>&#8216;(III) in the case of the verification of a previously hired individual, the later of--</p></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>&#8216;(aa) 3 years after the date of the completion of verification; or</p><p>&#8216;(bb) 1 year after the date the individual&#8217;s employment is terminated;</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><p>&#8216;(ii) make an inquiry, as provided in paragraph (7), using the verification system to seek verification of the identity and employment eligibility of an individual, by not later than the end of 3 working days (as specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security) after the date of the hiring or in the case of previously hired individuals, the date specified in paragraph (8)(B), or before the recruiting or referring commences; and</p><p>&#8216;(iii) not commence recruitment or referral of the individual until the person or entity receives verification under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (D).</p></ul><p>&#8216;(B) INITIAL RESPONSE- The verification system shall provide verification or a tentative nonverification of an individual&#8217;s identity and employment eligibility within 3 working days of the initial inquiry.
