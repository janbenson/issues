<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">(a) Findings- Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled military retirees were required to fund their own veterans&#x2019; disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned retired pay for each dollar received in veterans&#x2019; disability compensation.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and for combat-disabled retirees.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new thresholds.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) Congress is not content with the status quo.</p></ul><p nid="t0:ih:23">(b) Sense of Congress- It is the sense of Congress that military retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United States should not be reduced because a military retiree is also eligible for veterans&#x2019; disability compensation awarded for service-connected disability.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:24">SEC. 3.
