                                  19               House Armed Services Committee on August 1,
                                  20               2012, ‘‘Sequestration, by design, is bad policy, and

                                    1              to submit to Congress a detailed report on the im-

                                    6              pacts of sequestration, stating instead that, ‘‘no

                                    8              pact of the sequestration’’.
