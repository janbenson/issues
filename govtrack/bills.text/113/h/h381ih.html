<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Reinvesting and Ensuring America&#8217;s Ability to Lead Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) The bedrock of the Nation&#8217;s economic strength and future growth will be directly attributed to the robust Federal investment in critical areas such as education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p><p>(2) Recognizing the importance of education and its role in maintaining America&#8217;s position as an economic global leader, President George H.W. Bush stated that &#8216;U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.&#8217;.</p><p>(3) As President Bill Clinton recognized when he created the National Economic Council in 1992, &#8216;The currency of national strength in this new era will be denominated not only in ships and tanks and planes, but in diplomas and patents and paychecks.&#8217;.</p><p>(4) Recognizing diplomas and patents will not occur without investing in education, President George W. Bush stated that &#8216;we must address the low standing of American test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science, the very subjects most likely to affect our future competitiveness.&#8217;.</p><p>(5) Similarly, President Obama has stated that America&#8217;s future economic growth and international competitiveness depend on our Nation&#8217;s willingness to educate, invest, and innovate.</p><p>(6) As stated in a recent report from the National Economic Council, the Nation must &#8216;create the jobs and industries of the future by doing what America does best--investing in the creativity and imagination of our people. To win the future, we must out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.&#8217;.</p><p>(7) Accordingly, Congress should be provided the means to evaluate legislative worth beyond its impact to the annual budget.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
