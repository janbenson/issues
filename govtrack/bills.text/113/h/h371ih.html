<ul><p>A Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, to comply with the requirements of section 2, above, must include the following provisions:</p><ul><p>(1) Total outlays of the United States for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States except those for repayment of debt principal. The United States shall have no fiscal year deficits except pursuant to the terms of the Amendment.</p><p>(2) The fiscal year deficit prohibition described herein may be suspended by a majority of the membership of both houses of Congress, by rollcall vote, for any fiscal year in which the United States is actively engaged in military conflict pursuant to a war declared by Congress pursuant to article I, section 8, or may be suspended by four-fifths of the membership of Congress, by rollcall vote, for any other fiscal year.</p><p>(3) In any fiscal year in which Congress does not suspend the Amendment pursuant to its terms and in which total outlays will or may exceed total receipts, the President shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure total outlays for that fiscal year do not exceed total receipts. The President may not order any increase in taxes or other revenue measures to enforce the Amendment.
