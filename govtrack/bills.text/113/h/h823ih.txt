                                    6     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.
                                    7              The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the Amer-




                                    8 ican space program will always be the best in the world,
                                    9 and to ensure that America will always be able to preserve


                                                                                             2
                                    1 and protect our leadership in the exploration of outer
                                    2 space, the high ground of the future. Congress is hopeful
                                    3 that by restructuring NASA we can make the Agency less
                                    4 political and more professional so that visionary NASA
                                    5 scientists, engineers, and astronauts will continue to in-
                                    6 spire future generations by their continuing mission: to
                                    7 explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life, to boldly
                                    8 go where no one has gone before.
