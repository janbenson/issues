<ul><p>Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>(1) President Barack Obama has announced an Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, with the goal of concluding a final agreement between the United States and Afghanistan by May 2, 2013.</p><p>(2) The Agreement envisions commitments that directly affect the national security of the United States, including a commitment to assist Afghanistan &#8216;to deter threats against its sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity&#8217;.</p><p>(3) The Agreement fails to make clear the future basing structure of United States forces in Afghanistan.</p><p>(4) The Agreement fails to specify the future mission profile of United States forces in Afghanistan, the future number of United States forces deployed to Afghanistan, and the length of deployments for United States forces in Afghanistan.</p><p>(5) The Agreement fails to specify the extent to which United States military personnel and government contractors will be accountable under the laws of Afghanistan.</p><p>(6) Congress is a co-equal branch of government and as such the extension of long-term United States security commitments to Afghanistan that obligates or requires the appropriation of United States funds requires the full participation and consent of Congress.</p><p>(7) Under the Constitution, legislative approval of an international agreement can take the form either of approval of a treaty by two-thirds of the Senate under article II or authorization of the agreement by a simple majority of both houses of Congress under article I.</p><p>(8) Past presidential practice with regard to international agreements other than treaties has been regulated by Department of State guidelines that call for &#8216;due consideration&#8217; of &#8216;the extent to which the agreement involves commitments or risks affecting the nation as a whole,&#8217; &#8216;whether the agreement can be given effect without the enactment of subsequent legislation by the Congress,&#8217; and &#8216;the preference of the Congress&#8217;.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
