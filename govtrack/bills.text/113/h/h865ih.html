<ul><p>The Congress finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) the African Burial Ground National Historic Landmark in New York, New York, holds the remains of up to 20,000 enslaved Africans and early-generation African-Americans from the colonial era;</p><p>(2) the Africans and African-Americans that suffered under slavery show us the strength of the human character and provide us with a model of courage, commitment, and perseverance;</p><p>(3) as President George W. Bush stated on July 8, 2003, during his remarks at Goree Island, Senegal: &#8216;For 250 years the captives endured an assault on their culture and their dignity. The spirit of Africans in America did not break. . . . All the generations of oppression under the laws of man could not crush the hope of freedom and defeat the purposes of God.&#8217;;</p><p>(4) on February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush established the National Monument, which was comprised of the approximately 15,000-square-foot parcel of the National Historic Landmark that was bounded by Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan;</p><p>(5) an international memorial museum facility dedicated to those individuals who suffered the grave injustice of slavery in the United States, while at the same time helping to build the country, would--</p><ul><p>(A) reflect the significance of the African Burial Ground; and</p><p>(B) help the people of the United States understand the past and honor the history of all people in the United States;</p></ul><p>(6) in 1998, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution--</p><ul><p>(A) stated that the African Burial Ground affords the perfect opportunity to gain insight into--</p><ul><p>(i) the institution of slavery, as practiced in urban, rural, northern, and southern parts of the United States; and</p><p>(ii) the international slave trade; and</p></ul><p>(B) proposed that a partnership be formed among the Smithsonian, the National Park Service, and the General Services Administration to further develop the African Burial Ground;</p></ul><p>(7) the National Museum of African American History and Culture Act (20 U.S.C. 80r et seq.), which authorized construction of a museum in Washington, DC, identified the period of slavery as one of the periods of the African-American diaspora that would be encompassed by the museum;</p><p>(8) the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p>(A) is unlike any other anthropological and symbolic site in the United States or the world;</p><p>(B) includes DNA samples from the remarkably well-preserved human remains that will enable researchers to trace the home &#8216;roots&#8217; in Africa of those individuals buried at the African Burial Ground; and</p><p>(C) provides a fitting location for a national memorial facility, relating to the National Museum of African American History and Culture that would--</p><ul><p>(i) pay special tribute to--</p><ul><p>(I) the thousands of enslaved individuals who are buried at the African Burial Ground; and</p><p>(II) all of the individuals who were enslaved during the history of the United States;</p></ul><p>(ii) examine the African cultural traditions brought to the United States by the enslaved; and</p><p>(iii) explore in-depth the institution of slavery;</p></ul></ul><p>(9) a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p>(A) was first recommended by a Federal steering committee in 1992; and</p><p>(B) in conjunction with the planned World Trade Center memorial and other nearby sites, would attract millions of visitors from the United States and abroad, making a substantial contribution to the development and revitalization of Lower Manhattan in response to the attacks on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001;</p></ul><p>(10) Public Law 99-511 (100 Stat. 2080) encouraged support for the establishment of a commemorative structure within the National Park System or on other Federal land that is dedicated to the promotion of understanding, knowledge, opportunity, and equality for all people;</p><p>(11) similar to the National Museum of the Native American that was established by section 3(a) of the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 U.S.C. 80q-1(a)), a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground would benefit from a partnership among--</p><ul><p>(A) the Federal Government;</p><p>(B) the State of New York;</p><p>(C) the city of New York; and</p><p>(D) members of the private sector;</p></ul><p>(12) the African Burial Ground--</p><ul><p>(A) has been determined to be nationally significant as--</p><ul><p>(i) a National Historic Landmark; and</p><p>(ii) a National Monument; and</p></ul><p>(B) provides an important opportunity for interpretation, understanding, partnership and pride; and</p></ul><p>(13) the National Park Service--</p><ul><p>(A) has played an important role in the development of the African Burial Ground (including the designation of the African Burial Ground as a National Monument);</p><p>(B) successfully operates other national facilities in the city of New York that symbolize freedom and the quest for freedom in America, including--</p><ul><p>(i) the Statue of Liberty National Monument; and</p><p>(ii) Ellis Island National Monument;</p></ul><p>(C) provided key support to the Presidential Study Commission for the National Museum of African American History and Culture; and</p><p>(D) is well-suited to assume a leadership role with respect to the creation of the Museum.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
