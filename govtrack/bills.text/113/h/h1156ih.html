<p>To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the boundary of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and the North Cascades National Park in order to allow the rebuilding of a road outside of the floodplain while ensuring that there is no net loss of acreage to the Park or the Wilderness, and for other purposes.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p>(1) In 1988, 93 percent of the North Cascades National Park Complex was designated the Stephen Mather Wilderness.</p><p>(2) A road corridor was deliberately excluded from the wilderness designation to provide for the continued use and maintenance of the upper Stehekin Valley Road.</p><p>(3) The upper Stehekin Valley Road provides access to Stephen Mather Wilderness trailheads and North Cascades National Park from the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.</p><p>(4) Record flooding in 1995 and again in 2003 caused severe damage to the upper Stehekin Valley Road and led to the closure of a 9.9-mile section of the road between Car Wash Falls and Cottonwood Camp.</p><p>(5) The National Park Service currently does not have the flexibility to rebuild the upper Stehekin Valley Road away from the Stehekin River due to the current location of the non-wilderness road corridor provided by Congress in 1988.</p><p>(6) It is a high priority that the people of the United States, including families, the disabled, and the elderly, have reasonable access to the National Parks system and their public lands.</p><p>(7) The 1995 Lake Chelan National Recreation Area General Management Plan calls for retaining vehicle access to Cottonwood Camp.</p><p>(8) Tourism associated with the North Cascades National Park Complex is an important part of the economy for rural communities in the area.</p><p>(9) Additional management flexibility would allow the National Park Service to consider retention of the upper Stehekin Valley Road in a manner that provides for no net loss of wilderness.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-668) is amended by inserting after section 206 the following:</p></ul><p/><blockquote><h3>&#8216;SEC. 207. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS FOR ROAD.</h3>
