<p>Mr. WAXMAN (for himself and Ms. SLAUGHTER) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce</p><hr/><p/><center><p>A BILL</p></center>
<p>To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enhance the reporting requirements pertaining to use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals.</p><ul><p><em>  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em></p></ul><p/><h3>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) Antimicrobials are of critical importance to public health and to the American economy.</p><p>(2) Use of antimicrobials, whether in human medicine or in agriculture, contributes to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>(3) Data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicate that approximately 80 percent of all antimicrobials sold in the United States, over 29,000,000 pounds in 2009, were sold for use in food animals.</p><p>(4) A study published in September, 2012, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that even low doses of antimicrobials in animal feed for short periods of time increased the prevalence of the bacteria E. coli and the prevalence and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria in pigs.</p><p>(5) Public Law 110-316, the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008, requires producers of drugs used in food animals to provide specified information annually to the FDA on the sales and indications for use of such drugs.</p><p>(6) A September 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office found that the data provided to the FDA under the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments Act of 2008 lacked sufficient details necessary to analyze trends in antimicrobial resistance, such as information on actual drug use in specific food-producing animal species.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h3>
<ul><p>The purpose of this Act is to provide the Food and Drug Administration and the public with better information on the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals used for food to--</p><ul><p>(1) enable public health officials and scientists to better understand and interpret trends and variations in rates of microbial resistance to such antimicrobial drugs;</p><p>(2) improve the understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial drug use in animals used for food and antimicrobial drug resistance in microbes in and on animals and humans; and</p><p>(3) identify interventions to prevent and control such antimicrobial drug resistance.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 4. ENHANCED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.</h3>
<ul><p>(a) Reports- Section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(l)) is amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:</p><blockquote><ul><p>&#8216;(3)(A) In the case of each new animal drug described in paragraph (1) that contains an antimicrobial active ingredient, the sponsor of the drug shall submit an annual report to the Secretary on the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient in the drug that is sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals, including information on any distributor-labeled product.</p><p>&#8216;(B) Each report under this paragraph shall specify the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) by container size, strength, and dosage form;</p><p>&#8216;(ii) by quantities distributed to each State domestically and by quantities exported; and</p><p>&#8216;(iii) by dosage form, including (for each dosage form) the known or estimated amounts of the antimicrobial active ingredient sold or distributed for use in each food-producing animal for which the new animal drug is approved, including a description of the methods used to determine or estimate the amounts.</p></ul><p>&#8216;(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in the case of animal feed in final formulation bearing or containing a new animal drug for which reporting is required under paragraph (3), a live poultry dealer, swine contractor, or feed lot operator who purchases, contracts, or manufactures such feed shall submit to the Secretary an annual report that specifies, by food-producing animal for which the new animal drug is approved and, where applicable as determined by the Secretary, by production class of such animal--</p><ul><p>&#8216;(i) the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient contained per kilogram of each such feed sold or distributed for that animal and, where applicable, production class;</p><p>&#8216;(ii) the quantity of such feed sold or distributed for that animal and, where applicable, production class;
