A State may exercise authority under this Act beginning 90 days after the State publishes notice of the State&#8217;s intent to exercise the authority under this Act, but no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p><p>(b) Alternative- A State that is not a Member State under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized notwithstanding any other provision of law to require all sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that State, but only if the State adopts and implements the minimum simplification requirements in paragraph (2).
