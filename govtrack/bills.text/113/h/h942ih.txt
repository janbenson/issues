                                    4              This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring Access to

                                    6     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
                                    7              Congress finds the following:


                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Individuals with disabilities and significant
                                    2              medical conditions such as Cerebral Palsy, Muscular

                                    7                        (2) Complex rehabilitation technology items (in
                                    8              this Act referred to as ‘‘CRT items’’), including
                                    9              products such as complex rehabilitation power wheel-
                                  10               chairs, highly configurable manual wheelchairs,
                                  11               adaptive seating and positioning systems, and other
                                  12               specialized equipment, such as standing frames and
                                  13               gait trainers, enable individuals to maximize their
                                  14               function and minimize the extent and costs of their
                                  15               medical care.
                                  16                         (3) Access to CRT items and related services
                                  17               can be threatened by inadequate coding, coverage,
                                  18               and payment policies for such items and services.
                                  19               These policies have restricted access to existing com-

                                  21               Access challenges have increased over the past sev-
                                  22               eral years and, without meaningful change to these
                                  23               policies, will only become greater in the future.
                                  24                         (4) Current Medicare policies often fail to ade-

                                    1              ities, to consider the range of services furnished by
                                    2              complex rehabilitation technology suppliers, and to
                                    3              recognize and account for the complexity and unique
                                    4              nature of the equipment itself.
                                    5                        (5) A significant factor responsible for such ac-
                                    6              cess challenges is that individually-configurable CRT
                                    7              items do not have a distinct payment category under
                                    8              the Medicare program, but instead are classified
                                    9              within the broad category of durable medical equip-
                                  10               ment (DME). CRT items serve patients with serious
                                  11               medical conditions that require a broader range of
                                  12               services and specialized personnel than what is re-
                                  13               quired for standard DME. Customizable CRT items
                                  14               also require more resources in the areas configuring,
                                  15               training, and education to ensure appropriate use
                                  16               and to optimize results.
                                  17                         (6) Unlike most DME, a medical model incor-
                                  18               porating an interdisciplinary team approach is nec-
                                  19               essary to ensure proper customization and use of a
                                  20               CRT item. This team typically includes a physician,
                                  21               a licensed physical or licensed occupational therapist
                                  22               (with no financial relationship with the CRT sup-
                                  23               plier), a qualified CRT professional, the individual
                                  24               using such item, and sometimes a caregiver for such




                                  25               individual.

                                    1                        (7) The Medicare program should recognize the
                                    2              specialized nature of the CRT service delivery model,
                                    3              the required supporting processes and technology-re-
                                    4              lated CRT services, the credentials and competencies
                                    5              needed by the providing suppliers and critical staff,
                                    6              and the related costs involved. A separate benefit
                                    7              category for CRT items would allow for unique cod-

                                    9              address the unique needs of persons with disabilities
                                  10               and acknowledge the extensive service component.
                                  11                         (8) Congress and the Centers for Medicare &
                                  12               Medicaid Services have previously recognized the
                                  13               benefits of a separate classification for unique, cus-

                                  17               has created a separate and distinct benefit category
                                  18               for orthotics and prosthetics (custom braces and ar-
