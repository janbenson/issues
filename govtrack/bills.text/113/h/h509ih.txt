                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) Disability is a natural part of the human
                                    2              experience and in no way should diminish the oppor-
                                    3              tunity of citizens with disabilities, including individ-
                                    4              uals with the most significant disabilities, for full
                                    5              participation in society (including school, work, fam-
                                    6              ily, social engagement, interpersonal relationships,
                                    7              and community), independent living, and economic

                                    9                        (2) Self-determination and informed choice are
                                  10               essential elements in all program and service op-

                                  13               tivity both for individuals and society. Employment
                                  14               provides both tangible and intangible benefits. Em-
                                  15               ployment helps people achieve independence and eco-
                                  16               nomic self-sufficiency. Employment also gives people
                                  17               purpose, dignity, self-esteem, and a sense of accom-
                                  18               plishment and pride as well as an ability to con-
                                  19               tribute to society as a whole.
                                  20                         (4) Individuals with disabilities, including those
                                  21               with the most significant disabilities, should enjoy a
                                  22               presumption that they can achieve integrated em-
                                  23               ployment with appropriate services and supports.
