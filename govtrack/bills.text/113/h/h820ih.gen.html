<ul><p nid="t0:ih:16">The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:17">(1) Antimicrobials are of critical importance to public health and to the American economy.</p><p nid="t0:ih:18">(2) Use of antimicrobials, whether in human medicine or in agriculture, contributes to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p nid="t0:ih:19">(3) Data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicate that approximately 80 percent of all antimicrobials sold in the United States, over 29,000,000 pounds in 2009, were sold for use in food animals.</p><p nid="t0:ih:20">(4) A study published in September, 2012, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that even low doses of antimicrobials in animal feed for short periods of time increased the prevalence of the bacteria E. coli and the prevalence and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria in pigs.</p><p nid="t0:ih:21">(5) <public-law-reference session="110" number="316">Public Law 110-316</public-law-reference>, the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008, requires producers of drugs used in food animals to provide specified information annually to the FDA on the sales and indications for use of such drugs.</p><p nid="t0:ih:22">(6) A September 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office found that the data provided to the FDA under the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments Act of 2008 lacked sufficient details necessary to analyze trends in antimicrobial resistance, such as information on actual drug use in specific food-producing animal species.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:23">SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:ih:24">The purpose of this Act is to provide the Food and Drug Administration and the public with better information on the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals used for food to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:ih:25">(1) enable public health officials and scientists to better understand and interpret trends and variations in rates of microbial resistance to such antimicrobial drugs;</p><p nid="t0:ih:26">(2) improve the understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial drug use in animals used for food and antimicrobial drug resistance in microbes in and on animals and humans; and</p><p nid="t0:ih:27">(3) identify interventions to prevent and control such antimicrobial drug resistance.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:ih:28">SEC. 4.
