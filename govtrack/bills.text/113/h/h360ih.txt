                                    6                        (2) The senseless and premature death of these
                                    7              4 little Black girls sparked ‘‘The Movement that

                                  16               Movement and sparked a surge of momentum that
                                  17               helped secure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
                                  18               1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by

                                  21               girls and their families until 2002, 39 years after
                                  22               the bombing, when the last of the 4 Klansmen re-
