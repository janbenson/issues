 3       (b) For fiscal year 2013 and thereafter, the Bureau
 4 of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall include
 5 in all such data releases, language similar to the following
 6 that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to
 7 draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:
 8             (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law en-
 9       forcement authorities in conducting investigations by
10       tracking the sale and possession of specific firearms.
11       Law enforcement agencies may request firearms traces
12       for any reason, and those reasons are not necessarily
13       reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms
14       used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced
15       are used in crime.
16             (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen
17       for purposes of determining which types, makes, or
18       models of firearms are used for illicit purposes. The
19       firearms selected do not constitute a random sample
20       and should not be considered representative of the
21       larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or
22       any subset of that universe. Firearms are normally
23       traced to the first retail seller, and sources reported
24       for firearms traced do not necessarily represent the

 8 or conference held in connection with planning, training,
 9 assessment, review, or other routine purposes related to a
10 project funded by the grant or contract.
