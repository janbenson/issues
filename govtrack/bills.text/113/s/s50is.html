SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Strengthening Protections for Children and Communities From Disease Clusters Act&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) children are particularly at risk from environmental pollutants or toxic substances for various reasons, including because--</p><ul><p>(A) the nervous, immune, digestive, and other systems of children are still developing as the children move though several stages of rapid growth and development;</p><p>(B) exposure to environmental pollutants or toxic substances can affect prenatal, infant, and childhood growth and development;</p><p>(C) children may be less able to detoxify and excrete toxins than adults;</p><p>(D) children eat proportionately more food, drink more fluids, breathe more air, and play outside more, which means children are more exposed to environmental pollutants and toxic substances than adults;</p><p>(E) children are less able to protect themselves from exposures to environmental pollutants or toxic substances;</p><p>(F) the behavior of children exposes children to different environmental pollutants and toxic substances than adults;</p><p>(G) the natural curiosity and tendency of children to explore leaves children open to health risks that adults can more easily avoid; and</p><p>(H) the developing brains, reproductive systems, and other organs of children are more susceptible to permanent disruption that can result in health problems during the lives of the children;</p></ul><p>(2) according to the Department of Health and Human Services, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the first year of life, accounting for about 20 percent of infant deaths in 2006;</p><p>(3) according to the American Cancer Society, cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, exceeded only by accidents;</p><p>(4) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder;</p><p>(5) scientific research on environmental, genetic, and other influences that may affect environmental health is a national priority;</p><p>(6) Federal agencies should work to address serious environmental health problems to better protect children and other individuals in communities, both large and small, across the United States; and</p><p>(7) according to the National Academy of Sciences--</p><ul><p>(A) it is in the national interest to place a higher priority on the health of children;</p><p>(B) in the short term, that priority will result in children whose health and quality of life is improved and who are more ready and able to learn;</p><p>(C) children have important value in their own right and are worthy of that type of societal commitment;</p><p>(D) it is also in the national interest to optimize the health of children because, in the long term--</p><ul><p>(i) the continuing viability of society depends on a citizenry and a workforce that are properly equipped to be productive and committed to serving the country; and</p><p>(ii) failure to improve the health of children will have a substantial long-term consequence for the health of the adult population; and</p></ul><p>(E) investing in the health of children is necessary for all of the reasons described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) and is the right thing to do.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3. PURPOSES.</h3>
<ul><p>The purposes of this Act are--</p><ul><p>(1) to provide to the Administrator the authority to help conduct investigations into the potential for environmental pollutants or toxic substances to cause disease clusters;</p><p>(2) to ensure that the Administrator has the authority to undertake actions to help address existing and potential environmental pollution and toxic substances that may contribute to the creation of disease clusters; and</p><p>(3) to enable the Administrator to integrate and work in conjunction with other Federal, State, and local agencies, institutions of higher education, and the public in investigating and helping to address the possible causes of disease clusters.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 4. GOALS.</h3>
<ul><p>The goals of this Act are--</p><ul><p>(1) to protect and assist pregnant women, infants, children, and other individuals who have been, are, or could be harmed by, and become part of, a disease cluster;</p><p>(2) to enhance Federal resources, expertise, outreach, transparency, and accountability in responding to public and State and local government inquiries about the potential causes of a disease cluster;</p><p>(3) to strengthen Federal analytical capacity and coordination, including with State and local authorities, in the investigation of the potential causes of disease clusters;</p><p>(4) to develop multidisciplinary teams that undertake a systematic, integrated approach to investigate and help address the potential causes of disease clusters that State and local officials cannot address or need assistance in addressing; and</p><p>(5) to help facilitate the rapid investigation of potential disease clusters and actions to address the potential causes of disease clusters.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 5.
