<ul><p nid="t0:is:21">&#x2018;Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:22">&#x2018;(1) Investments in children and early childhood development education should be a national priority.</p><p nid="t0:is:23">&#x2018;(2) State-funded preschool is the most rapidly expanding segment of the United States educational system, but in many States a lack of stable funding poses an enormous threat to the provision or continuation of high-quality preschool.</p><p nid="t0:is:24">&#x2018;(3) Researchers, educators, and economists have long noted an achievement gap for low-income and minority students as compared to their more advantaged peers that is often already evident when children enter school for the first time.</p><p nid="t0:is:25">&#x2018;(4) One study showed that before entering kindergarten, the average cognitive scores of preschool-age children in the highest socioeconomic group are 60 percent above the average scores of preschool-age children in the lowest socioeconomic group.</p><p nid="t0:is:26">&#x2018;(5) For low-income preschoolers, research shows that high-quality early education and development is vital to closing the achievement gap between them and their more advantaged peers.</p><p nid="t0:is:27">&#x2018;(6) Numerous studies have shown that high-quality preschool programs--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:28">&#x2018;(A) improve a number of specific life outcomes for children; and</p><p nid="t0:is:29">&#x2018;(B) are cost-effective.</p></ul><p nid="t0:is:30">&#x2018;(7) The provision of high-quality prekindergarten is a cost-effective investment for children and for the Nation. Research shows that for every $1 invested in high-quality early childhood programs, taxpayers save up to $7 in crime, welfare, remedial and special education, and other costs.</p><p nid="t0:is:31">&#x2018;(8) High-quality early education increases academic success for schoolchildren who received that education by--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:32">&#x2018;(A) improving skills in areas such as following directions and problem solving;</p><p nid="t0:is:33">&#x2018;(B) improving students&#x2019; performance on standardized tests;</p><p nid="t0:is:34">&#x2018;(C) reducing grade repetition;</p><p nid="t0:is:35">&#x2018;(D) reducing the number of students placed in special education; and</p><p nid="t0:is:36">&#x2018;(E) increasing secondary school graduation rates.</p></ul><p nid="t0:is:37">&#x2018;(9) High-quality early education promotes responsible behavior by teens and adults who received that education by--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:38">&#x2018;(A) reducing crime, delinquency, and unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and drug use;</p><p nid="t0:is:39">&#x2018;(B) lowering rates of teen pregnancy;</p><p nid="t0:is:40">&#x2018;(C) leading to greater employment and higher wages for adults; and</p><p nid="t0:is:41">&#x2018;(D) contributing to more stable families.</p></ul><p nid="t0:is:42">&#x2018;(10) High-quality prekindergarten programs prepare children to--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:43">&#x2018;(A) succeed in school;</p><p nid="t0:is:44">&#x2018;(B) achieve higher levels of education; and</p><p nid="t0:is:45">&#x2018;(C) become citizens who--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:46">&#x2018;(i) earn more in adulthood;</p><p nid="t0:is:47">&#x2018;(ii) compete in the global economy; and</p><p nid="t0:is:48">&#x2018;(iii) contribute to our national prosperity.</p></ul></ul><p nid="t0:is:49">&#x2018;(11) The gap in developmental progress prior to preschool is significant for thousands of young children, and needs to be addressed in order to have a strong foundation for children&#x2019;s progress in preschool and later years.</p></ul></ul></blockquote><p/><blockquote><h3 nid="t0:is:50">&#x2018;SEC. 1842.
