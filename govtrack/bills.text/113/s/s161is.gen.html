<ul><p nid="t0:is:16">Congress finds that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:17">(1) the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians is a political successor to signatories of the Pembina Treaty of 1863, under which a large area of land in the State of North Dakota was ceded to the United States;</p><p nid="t0:is:18">(2) the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy&#x2019;s Reservation of Montana, which also are political successors to the signatories of the Pembina Treaty of 1863, have been recognized by the Federal Government as distinct Indian tribes;</p><p nid="t0:is:19">(3) the members of the Little Shell Tribe continue to live in the State of Montana, as their ancestors have for more than 100 years since ceding land in the State of North Dakota as described in paragraph (1);</p><p nid="t0:is:20">(4) in the 1930s and 1940s, the Tribe repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government for reorganization under the Act of June 18, 1934 (<usc-reference title="25" section="461" paragraph="">25 U.S.C. 461</usc-reference> et seq.)

(commonly known as the &#x2018;Indian Reorganization Act&#x2019;);</p><p nid="t0:is:22">(6) due to a lack of Federal appropriations during the Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs lacked adequate financial resources to purchase land for the Tribe, and the members of the Tribe were denied the opportunity to reorganize;</p><p nid="t0:is:23">(7) in spite of the failure of the Federal Government to appropriate adequate funding to secure land for the Tribe as required for reorganization under the Act of June 18, 1934 (<usc-reference title="25" section="461" paragraph="">25 U.S.C. 461</usc-reference> et seq.)
