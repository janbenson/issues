                                    4              Birth Defects.
                                    5                        (2) In the decades that have passed since Fetal
                                    6              Alcohol Syndrome was first recognized in the United
                                    7              States, this fully preventable condition has continued
                                    8              to affect American children and families.
                                    9                        (3) Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause brain
                                  10               damage that produces cognitive and behavioral im-
                                  11               pairments. Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause in-
                                  12               tellectual disabilities or low IQ and difficulties with
                                  13               learning, memory, attention, and problem solving. It
                                  14               can also create problems with executive functioning
                                  15               and adaptive behavior that impairs mental health
                                  16               and social interaction. Prenatal alcohol exposure
                                  17               does not always result in below average IQ or visible
                                  18               birth defects, which makes Fetal Alcohol Spectrum

                                  21                         (4) Prenatal alcohol exposure also can cause
                                  22               growth retardation, birth defects involving the heart,
