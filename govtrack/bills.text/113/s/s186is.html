FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p>(1) September 15, 2013, will mark 50 years since the lives of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, known as the &#8216;4 little Black girls&#8217;, were suddenly taken by a bomb planted in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>(2) The senseless and premature death of the 4 little Black girls sparked &#8216;The Movement that Changed the World&#8217;.</p><p>(3) On that tragic Sunday in September of 1963, the world took notice of the violence inflicted in the struggle for equal rights.</p><p>(4) The fact that 4 innocent children lost their lives as they prepared for Sunday School shook the world&#8217;s conscience.</p><p>(5) This tragedy galvanized the Civil Rights Movement and sparked a surge of momentum that helped secure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which were signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p><p>(6) Justice was delayed for these 4 little Black girls and their families until 2002, 39 years after the bombing, when the last of the Klansmen responsible for the bombing was convicted of the crime.</p><p>(7) The 4 little Black girls are emblematic of so many who have lost their lives for the cause of freedom and equality, including Virgil Ware and Johnny Robinson, who were children also killed within hours of the 1963 church bombing.</p><p>(8) The legacy that these 4 little Black girls left will live on in the minds and hearts of us all for generations to come.</p><p>(9) Their extraordinary sacrifice sparked real and lasting change as Congress began to aggressively pass legislation that ensured equality.</p><p>(10) Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remains a powerful symbol of the movement for civil and human rights and will host the 50th anniversary ceremony on Sunday, September 15, 2013.</p><p>(11) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2013 to the 4 little Black girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, posthumously in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the historical significance of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2.
