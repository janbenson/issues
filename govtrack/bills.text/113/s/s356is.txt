                                    7              Congress makes the following findings:





                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) At least by 20 weeks after fertilization, an
                                    2              unborn child has the physical structures necessary to
                                    3              experience pain.
                                    4                        (2) There is substantial evidence that by 20
                                    5              weeks after fertilization, unborn children draw away
                                    6              from certain stimuli in a manner which in an infant
                                    7              or an adult would be interpreted as a response to
                                    8              pain.
                                    9                        (3) Anesthesia is routinely administered to un-

                                  11               after fertilization who undergo prenatal surgery.
                                  12                         (4) There is substantial evidence that the abor-

                                  14               after fertilization cause substantial pain to an un-
                                  15               born child, whether by dismemberment, poisoning,
                                  16               penetrating or crushing the skull, or other methods.
                                  17               Examples of abortion methods used 20 weeks or

                                    3                        pulled out until only the head remains. The
                                    4                        head is then grasped and crushed in order to

                                  15               after fertilization an unborn child may experience

                                  18                         (6) Medical science is capable of reducing such
                                  19               pain through the administration of anesthesia or
