<ul><p>(a) Findings- Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p>(1) The present decentralized system for filing Federal tax liens in local property offices, which was established before the advent of modern computers, the Internet, and e-government programs, is inefficient, burdensome, and expensive.</p><p>(2) Current technology permits the creation of a centralized Federal tax lien filing system which can provide for enhanced public notice of and access to accurate tax lien information in a manner that is more efficient, more timely, and less burdensome than the existing tax lien filing system; which would expedite the release of liens; and which would be less expensive for both taxpayers and users.</p></ul><p>(b) Purpose- The purpose of this subtitle is to simplify and modernize the process for filing notices of Federal tax liens, to improve public access to tax lien information, and to save taxpayer dollars by establishing a nationwide, Internet accessible, and fully searchable filing system for Federal tax liens which would replace the current system of local tax lien filings.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 213.
