<ul><p>Congress finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) unlike cows, pigs, and other domesticated species, horses and other members of the equidae family are not raised for the purpose of human consumption;</p><p>(2) equines raised in the United States are frequently treated with substances that are not approved for use in horses intended for human consumption and equine parts are therefore unsafe within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;</p><p>(3) equines raised in the United States are frequently treated with drugs, including phenylbutazone, acepromazine, boldenone undecylenate, omeprazole, ketoprofen, xylazine, hyaluronic acid, nitrofurazone, polysulfated glycosaminoglycan, clenbuterol, tolazoline, and ponazuril, which are not approved for use in horses intended for human consumption and equine parts are therefore unsafe within the meaning of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and</p><p>(4) consuming parts of an equine raised in the United States likely poses a serious threat to human health and the public should be protected from these unsafe products.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
