<ul><p>Congress finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) investment in water infrastructure is critical to protecting property and personal safety through flood, hurricane, and storm damage reduction activities;</p><p>(2) investment in infrastructure on the inland waterways of the United States is critical to the economy of the United States through the maintenance of safe, reliable, and efficient navigation for recreation and the movement of billions of dollars in goods each year;</p><p>(3) fiscal challenges facing Federal, State, local, and tribal governments require new and innovative financing structures to continue robust investment in public water infrastructure;</p><p>(4) under existing fiscal restraints and project delivery processes, large-scale water infrastructure projects like the lock and dam modernization on the upper Mississippi River and Illinois River will take decades to complete, with benefits for the lock modernization not expected to be realized until 2047;</p><p>(5) the Corps of Engineers has an estimated backlog of more than $60,000,000,000 in outstanding projects; and</p><p>(6) in developing innovative financing options for water infrastructure projects, any prior public investment in projects must be protected.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
