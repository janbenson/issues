<p/><h3 nid="t0:is:42">SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:is:43">The Congress finds the following:</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:44">(1) Monetary policy can only affect the level of employment in the short term because nonmonetary factors determine the level of employment in the long term. At best, the Federal Reserve may temporarily increase the level of employment through monetary policy, but such efforts risk the possibility of price inflation and increased business cycle volatility in the future. However, the Federal Reserve can achieve price stability in the long term through monetary policy. Price stability is desirable because both price inflation and price deflation damage the U.S. economy. Therefore, to maximize long-term economic growth and achieve the highest sustainable level of real output and employment, price stability should be the objective of monetary policy.</p><p nid="t0:is:45">(2) Countries whose central bank has a single mandate for price stability generally have a better record of achieving stable prices than countries whose central bank has a mandate that gives equal weight to other objectives such as maximum employment or low interest rates.</p><p nid="t0:is:46">(3) In general, an overly accommodative monetary policy inflates both asset prices and prices for goods and services. However, an overly accommodative monetary policy may sometimes cause a misallocation of capital that inflates asset prices disproportionately, creating unsustainable bubbles in asset prices, while price indices for goods and services do not register significant price inflation. When asset bubbles burst, many investments must be liquidated at considerable cost to the U.S. economy in terms of lower real output and employment.</p><p nid="t0:is:47">(4) Price stability cannot always be measured solely through price indices for goods and services since such indices exclude changes in asset prices. Therefore, the Federal Reserve should monitor (A) the prices of, and the expected returns from, major asset classes (including equities, residential real estate, commercial and industrial real estate, agricultural real estate, gold and other commodities, corporate bonds, U.S. Government bonds, State and local government bonds, and other securities), (B) the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and (C) the value of the United States dollar relative to gold, as metrics to determine whether the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s monetary policy is consistent with long-term price stability.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:48">SEC. 102.

Specifically, the first undesignated paragraph under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act states that &#x2018;In selecting the members of the Board, not more than one of whom shall be selected from any one Federal Reserve District, the President shall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country.&#x2019;.</p><p nid="t0:is:115">(3) The Federal Open Monetary Committee consists of members of the Board of Governors and the President or Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on a permanent basis and rotates voting membership among the remaining Regional Reserve Banks.</p><p nid="t0:is:116">(4) The existing structure of the Federal Open Market Committee places too much authority in the hands of Washington and New York at the expense of the remainder of the United States.</p><p nid="t0:is:117">(5) Monetary policy should be conducted in the interest of all Americans and that policy goal is best achieved by a Federal Open Market Committee that provides greater representation and voice in policy decisions to the entire Nation as represented by the Regional Reserve Banks.
