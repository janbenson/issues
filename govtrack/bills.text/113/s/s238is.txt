                                    4              The Congress finds the following:
                                    5                        (1) Monetary policy can only affect the level of
                                    6              employment in the short term because nonmonetary




                                    7              factors determine the level of employment in the

                                                                                             3
                                    1              rarily increase the level of employment through mon-
                                    2              etary policy, but such efforts risk the possibility of
                                    3              price inflation and increased business cycle volatility
                                    4              in the future. However, the Federal Reserve can
                                    5              achieve price stability in the long term through mon-
                                    6              etary policy. Price stability is desirable because both
                                    7              price inflation and price deflation damage the U.S.
                                    8              economy. Therefore, to maximize long-term economic
                                    9              growth and achieve the highest sustainable level of
                                  10               real output and employment, price stability should
                                  11               be the objective of monetary policy.
                                  12                         (2) Countries whose central bank has a single
                                  13               mandate for price stability generally have a better
                                  14               record of achieving stable prices than countries
                                  15               whose central bank has a mandate that gives equal
                                  16               weight to other objectives such as maximum employ-
                                  17               ment or low interest rates.
                                  18                         (3) In general, an overly accommodative mone-
                                  19               tary policy inflates both asset prices and prices for
                                  20               goods and services. However, an overly accommoda-
                                  21               tive monetary policy may sometimes cause a
                                  22               misallocation of capital that inflates asset prices dis-
                                  23               proportionately, creating unsustainable bubbles in




                                  24               asset prices, while price indices for goods and serv-

                                    3              terms of lower real output and employment.
                                    4                        (4) Price stability cannot always be measured
                                    5              solely through price indices for goods and services
                                    6              since such indices exclude changes in asset prices.

                                  18               with long-term price stability.
