<ul><p nid="t0:is:16">Congress finds as follows:</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:17">(1) Family planning is basic health care for women. Access to contraception helps women prevent unintended pregnancy and control the timing and spacing of planned births.</p><p nid="t0:is:18">(2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included family planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations.</p><p nid="t0:is:19">(3) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.</p><p nid="t0:is:20">(4) Women rely on prescription contraceptives for a range of medical purposes in addition to birth control, such as regulation of cycles and endometriosis.</p><p nid="t0:is:21">(5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy and has approved over-the-counter access to some forms of emergency contraception for individuals aged 17 and older.</p><p nid="t0:is:22">(6) If taken soon after unprotected sex or primary contraceptive failure, emergency contraception can significantly reduce a woman&#x2019;s chance of unintended pregnancy.</p><p nid="t0:is:23">(7) Emergency contraception is approved to prevent pregnancy. It will not work if a woman is already pregnant.</p><p nid="t0:is:24">(8) Access to legal contraception is a protected fundamental right in the United States and should not be impeded by one individual&#x2019;s personal beliefs.</p><p nid="t0:is:25">(9) Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, have surfaced in States across the Nation, including Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Since emergency contraception became available without a prescription for certain individuals, refusals to provide non-prescription emergency contraception have also been reported.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:26">SEC. 3.
