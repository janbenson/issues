                                    2              take advantage of this new medium. As the public
                                    3              moves online, the Government must do so as well.

                                    5              seminating public information, the Federal Govern-
                                    6              ment should make all of its public information avail-
                                    7              able on the Internet. It should do so in ways that

                                  10               to the greatest number of people. The Government
                                  11               should strive to make its information available on
                                  12               the Internet in real-time and in machine processable

                                  15               brary will empower citizens of the United States to

                                  17               ment functions and what it does in their name. It
                                  18               will also give innovators new tools to build on this
                                  19               information and provide better goods and services to
                                  20               the people of the United States. Government services
                                  21               will be provided more efficiently, saving the tax-
                                  22               payers money and allowing them to be more involved
                                  23               in the lives of their communities.
