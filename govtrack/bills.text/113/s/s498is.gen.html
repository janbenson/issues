This agreement, which is known as the Global Political Agreement, became effective on September 15, 2008.</p><p nid="t0:is:43">(18) The Parliament of Zimbabwe amended the Constitution of Zimbabwe to allow for the creation of the power-sharing government.</p><p nid="t0:is:44">(19) While Mugabe retained the office of President, Tsvangirai was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe on February 11, 2009, and Tendai Biti was appointed Minister of Finance by Prime Minister Tsvangirai.</p><p nid="t0:is:45">(20) Since the appointment of Biti as Minister of Finance, the economy of Zimbabwe has seen remarkable recovery in a short period of time.
