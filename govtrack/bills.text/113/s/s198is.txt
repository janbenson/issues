                                    1                        (1) On August 26, 2011, a vehicle borne explo-
                                    2              sive device (VBIED) was detonated after being driv-
                                    3              en into the lobby of a United Nations facility in
                                    4              Abuja, Nigeria. At least 21 people died as a result
                                    5              of the explosion, and the Islamist militant organiza-
                                    6              tion commonly called ‘‘Boko Haram’’ claimed re-

                                    9              were detonated across northern Nigeria. Some of
                                  10               these attacks killed worshippers attending Christmas
                                  11               Day services, and killed an estimated total of 41

                                  14               killed hundreds of innocent civilians and has contin-
                                  15               ually enhanced its lethality, pledging to continue its
                                  16               use of terrorist tactics. In a July 2010 statement,

                                  18               port to al Qaeda and made threatening remarks to
                                  19               the United States.

                                  13               Howard F. Jeter described Boko Haram by saying,
                                  14               ‘‘It is a terrorist group. If you kill 28 innocent peo-
