SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p>This Act may be cited as the &#8216;Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2013&#8217;.</p></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p>Congress finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommends that the United States develop a Government wide Federal energy policy and update the policy regularly with strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews similar to the reviews conducted by the Department of Defense;</p><p>(2) as the lead agency in support of energy science and technology innovation, the Department of Energy has conducted a Quadrennial Technology Review of the energy technology policies and programs of the Department;</p><p>(3) the Quadrennial Technology Review of the Department of Energy serves as the basis for coordination with other agencies and on other programs for which the Department has a key role;</p><p>(4) a Quadrennial Energy Review would--</p><ul><p>(A) establish integrated, Government wide national energy objectives in the context of economic, environmental, and security priorities;</p><p>(B) coordinate actions across Federal agencies;</p><p>(C) identify the resources needed for the invention, adoption, and diffusion of energy technologies; and</p><p>(D) provide a strong analytical base for Federal energy policy decisions;</p></ul><p>(5) a Quadrennial Energy Review should be established taking into account estimated Federal budgetary resources;</p><p>(6) the development of an energy policy resulting from a Quadrennial Energy Review would--</p><ul><p>(A) enhance the energy security of the United States;</p><p>(B) create jobs; and</p><p>(C) mitigate environmental harm; and</p></ul><p>(7) while a Quadrennial Energy Review will be a product of the executive branch, the review will have substantial input from--</p><ul><p>(A) Congress;</p><p>(B) the energy industry;</p><p>(C) academia;</p><p>(D) nongovernmental organizations; and</p><p>(E) the public.</p></ul></ul></ul><p/><h3>SEC. 3.
