<ul><p>(a) Findings Relating to Federal Income Tax- Congress finds the Federal income tax--</p><ul><p>(1) retards economic growth and has reduced the standard of living of the American public;</p><p>(2) impedes the international competitiveness of United States industry;</p><p>(3) reduces savings and investment in the United States by taxing income multiple times;</p><p>(4) slows the capital formation necessary for real wages to steadily increase;</p><p>(5) lowers productivity;</p><p>(6) imposes unacceptable and unnecessary administrative and compliance costs on individual and business taxpayers;</p><p>(7) is unfair and inequitable;</p><p>(8) unnecessarily intrudes upon the privacy and civil rights of United States citizens;</p><p>(9) hides the true cost of government by embedding taxes in the costs of everything Americans buy;</p><p>(10) is not being complied with at satisfactory levels and therefore raises the tax burden on law abiding citizens; and</p><p>(11) impedes upward social mobility.</p></ul><p>(b) Findings Relating to Federal Payroll Taxes- Congress finds further that the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and self-employment taxes--</p><ul><p>(1) raise the cost of employment;</p><p>(2) destroy jobs and cause unemployment; and</p><p>(3) have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower income Americans.</p></ul><p>(c) Findings Relating to Federal Estate and Gift Taxes- Congress finds further that the Federal estate and gift taxes--</p><ul><p>(1) force family businesses and farms to be sold by the family to pay such taxes;</p><p>(2) discourage capital formation and entrepreneurship;</p><p>(3) foster the continued dominance of large enterprises over small family-owned companies and farms; and</p><p>(4) impose unacceptably high tax planning costs on small businesses and farms.</p></ul><p>(d) Findings Relating to National Sales Tax- Congress finds further that a broad-based national sales tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption--</p><ul><p>(1) is similar in many respects to the sales and use taxes in place in 45 of the 50 States;</p><p>(2) will promote savings and investment;</p><p>(3) will promote fairness;</p><p>(4) will promote economic growth;</p><p>(5) will raise the standard of living;</p><p>(6) will increase investment;</p><p>(7) will enhance productivity and international competitiveness;</p><p>(8) will reduce administrative burdens on the American taxpayer;</p><p>(9) will improve upward social mobility; and</p><p>(10) will respect the privacy interests and civil rights of taxpayers.</p></ul><p>(e) Findings Relating to Administration of National Sales Tax- Congress further finds that--</p><ul><p>(1) most of the practical experience administering sales taxes is found at the State governmental level;</p><p>(2) it is desirable to harmonize Federal and State collection and enforcement efforts to the maximum extent possible;</p><p>(3) it is sound tax administration policy to foster administration and collection of the Federal sales tax at the State level in return for a reasonable administration fee to the States; and</p><p>(4) businesses that must collect and remit taxes should receive reasonable compensation for the cost of doing so.</p></ul><p>(f) Findings Relating to Repeal of Present Federal Tax System- Congress further finds that the 16th amendment to the United States Constitution should be repealed.</p></ul><p/><h4><center><p>TITLE I--REPEAL OF THE INCOME TAX, PAYROLL TAXES, AND ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES</p></center></h4>
