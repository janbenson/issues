SHORT TITLE.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:is:14">This Act may be cited as the &#x2018;Children&#x2019;s Recovery from Trauma Act&#x2019;.</p></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:15">SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h3>
<ul><p nid="t0:is:16">Congress makes the following findings:</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:17">(1) According to a 2002 Government Accountability Office report (GAO-02-813), large numbers of children experience trauma-related mental health problems, while at the same time facing barriers to receiving appropriate mental health care.</p><p nid="t0:is:18">(2) According to the National Institute of Mental Health, only 36 percent of youth with any mental disorder received services, and only half of these youth who were severely impaired by their mental disorder received any professional mental health treatment. Of those with anxiety disorders (including post traumatic stress disorder), only 18 percent received services. Half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14, and that despite effective treatments that have been developed, there are long delays, sometimes decades, between first onset of symptoms and when treatment is obtained.</p><p nid="t0:is:19">(3) Findings from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study have shown that adverse childhood experiences predispose children towards negative trajectories from infancy to adulthood.</p><p nid="t0:is:20">(4) The Great Smoky Mountains Study, a representative longitudinal study of children, found that by age 16, more than 67 percent of the children had been exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as child maltreatment, domestic violence, or sexual assault (Copeland et al, 2007).</p><p nid="t0:is:21">(5) According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder for 13 to 18 year olds is 4 to 6 percent (NIMH, 2010). In 2007, the National Institute of Mental Health reported that adults who were abused or neglected as children have increased risk of major depression, often beginning in childhood with long-lasting effects.</p><p nid="t0:is:22">(6) According to the Department of Defense, more than 700,000 children have experienced one or more parental deployments. Children&#x2019;s reactions to a parent&#x2019;s deployment vary by a child&#x2019;s developmental stage, age, and presence of any preexisting psychological or behavioral problems. The mental health of the parent is often a key factor affecting the child&#x2019;s distress level. Parents reporting clinically significant stress are more likely to have children identified as high risk for psychological and behavioral problems.</p><p nid="t0:is:23">(7) The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey revealed that nearly 1 in 5 women reported having been the victim of a rape at some time during their lives. Forty-two percent experienced their first rape before the age of 18.</p><p nid="t0:is:24">(8) The National Child Traumatic Stress Network collected data on 14,088 children and adolescents served by 56 Network service centers across the country from 2004 to 2010, examining the prevalence of exposure to a wide range of trauma types, access to services, and child outcomes outcome. Nearly 80 percent of children referred for screening and evaluation reported experiencing at least one type of traumatic event. Of the 11,104 children and adolescents who reported trauma exposure, 77 percent had experienced more than one type of trauma and 31 percent had experienced five or more types.</p><p nid="t0:is:25">(9) The children served by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network are involved with many different kinds of child-serving systems. Of those receiving service, 65 percent had received social services and 35 percent had received school-based services. After treatment, significant improvements were made in trauma symptoms, mental health diagnoses, and behavioral problems.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:26">SEC. 3.
