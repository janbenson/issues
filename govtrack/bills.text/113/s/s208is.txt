                                    8                        (1) Residents throughout Los Angeles County

                                    6                        (6) As part of that process, several public meet-
                                    7              ings were held in the fall and summer of 2012 that
                                    8              have allowed the Federal Aviation Administration
                                    9              and stakeholders to hear and better understand the
                                  10               concerns and complaints of affected residents.
                                  11                         (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is

                                  17               copters can be regulated in Los Angeles County in
