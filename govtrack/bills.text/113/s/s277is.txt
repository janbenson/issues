                                    5 any provision of the Act to any person or circumstance.

                                    7 shall remain in effect. If a provision of this Act is held
                                    8 invalid in one or more of its applications to any person
                                    9 or circumstance, the Act shall remain in effect in all its

                                  11 of any provision of this Act, a reviewing court shall con-
                                  12 strue such provision as necessary to avoid any constitu-
                                  13 tional invalidity.
