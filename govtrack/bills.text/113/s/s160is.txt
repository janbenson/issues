                                    7              (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—





                                                                                             2
                                    1                        (1) medical debt is unique, and Americans do
                                    2              not choose when accidents happen or when illness
                                    3              strikes;
                                    4                        (2) medical debt collection issues affect both in-
                                    5              sured and uninsured consumers;
                                    6                        (3) according to credit evaluators, medical debt
                                    7              collections are more likely to be in dispute, inconsist-
                                    8              ently reported, and of questionable value in pre-
                                    9              dicting future payment performance because it is
                                  10               atypical and nonpredictive;
                                  11                         (4) nevertheless, medical debt that has been
                                  12               completely paid off or settled can significantly dam-
                                  13               age the credit score of a consumer for years;
                                  14                         (5) as a result, consumers may be denied credit
                                  15               or pay higher interest rates when buying a home or
                                  16               obtaining a credit card;
                                  17                         (6) healthcare providers are increasingly turn-
                                  18               ing to outside collection agencies to help secure pay-
                                  19               ment from patients, coming at the expense of the
                                  20               consumer, because medical debts are not typically
                                  21               reported unless they become assigned to collections;
                                  22                         (7) in fact, medical bills account for more than
                                  23               half of all non-credit related collection actions re-




                                  24               ported to consumer credit reporting agencies;

                                    2              consumers;
                                    3                        (9) according to the Commonwealth Fund, med-
                                    4              ical bill problems or accrued medical debt affects

                                    6              and
                                    7                        (10) in 2010, 30,000,000 working-age Amer-
                                    8              ican adults were contacted by a collection agency for
                                    9              unpaid medical bills.
                                  10               (b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ex-
