<ul><p nid="t0:is:16">Congress finds that--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:17">(1) it is in the national interest to encourage the timely and cost-effective rehabilitation and replacement of aging water and sewer infrastructure and to support investments in innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable infrastructure approaches to protect public health and clean water;</p><p nid="t0:is:18">(2) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, in the 20-year period following the date of enactment of this Act--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:19">(A) $334,800,000,000 is needed to invest in infrastructure improvements to ensure the provision of safe water; and</p><p nid="t0:is:20">(B) $298,100,000,000 is needed for publicly owned wastewater systems-related infrastructure;</p></ul><p nid="t0:is:21">(3) customer rates and local charges are and will remain the primary means of paying for water service and infrastructure in the United States;</p><p nid="t0:is:22">(4) the municipal bond market and State revolving fund programs are the primary long-term means for financing water infrastructure projects, but upfront investment needs are too high to be met with those traditional means alone;</p><p nid="t0:is:23">(5) financing constraints make it particularly difficult for State revolving funds to support large water infrastructure projects of regional and national significance;</p><p nid="t0:is:24">(6) the growing funding gap demonstrates the need to invest in innovative and cost-effective approaches such as green infrastructure, water efficiency, and source water protection to obtain the greatest environmental and public health benefits per dollar invested;</p><p nid="t0:is:25">(7) this Act will substantially benefit the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States by--</p><ul><p nid="t0:is:26">(A) addressing the gap in funding for large, regionally and nationally significant projects by making available direct loans and loan guarantees to reduce borrowing costs and accelerate water infrastructure investment;</p><p nid="t0:is:27">(B) enhancing the capacity of State revolving fund programs to assist other projects; and</p><p nid="t0:is:28">(C) promoting clean and safe water through compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (<usc-reference title="33" section="1251" paragraph="">33 U.S.C. 1251</usc-reference> et seq.) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (<usc-reference title="42" section="300f" paragraph="">42 U.S.C. 300f</usc-reference> et seq.);</p></ul><p nid="t0:is:29">(8) since the historical default rate on water and sewer bonds is 0.04 percent, the risk of default on Federal assistance provided under this Act is minimal;</p><p nid="t0:is:30">(9) keeping the risk of default on water and sewer bonds low requires the alignment of infrastructure investment with environmental sustainability; and</p><p nid="t0:is:31">(10) because loans, loan guarantees, and other credit instruments only incur long-term costs if subsidized or in the event of default, this Act can help to meet the water infrastructure needs of the United States at minimal long-term cost to the Federal Government.</p></ul></ul><p/><h3 nid="t0:is:32">SEC. 3.
