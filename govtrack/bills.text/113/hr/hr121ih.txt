                                  Whereas Yoani Sanchez has become a prominent voice
                                     through social media for millions of Cubans who reject
                                     the oppression of the Castro regime;

                                     Cuba, on September 4, 1975, and went on to major in
                                     Spanish Literature at the Pedagogical Institute before
                                     completing a degree in Hispanic Philology at the Univer-

                                  Whereas while working at Editorial Gente Nueva, Sanchez
                                     came to the realization that, like many Cubans, the
                                     wages she earned legally were not enough to support her


                                                                                             2
                                          family and highly qualified individuals were unable to
                                          find sufficient work;
                                  Whereas disenchanted and seeking greater economic opportu-
                                     nities, she moved to Switzerland in 2002 but returned to
                                     Cuba in the summer of 2004, discovering her passion for
                                     computer science;
                                                      ´
                                  Whereas in 2004, Sanchez and a group of like-minded com-
                                     patriots founded Consenso, a magazine of reflection and
                                     debate, and three years later she worked as a web mas-
                                     ter, columnist, and editor for the website Desde Cuba;

                                  Whereas in April 2007, Sanchez created the blog known as
                                     ‘‘Generation Y’’, which started as an outlet for self-ex-
                                     pression but has since found an audience with 500,000
                                     people around the world;
                                  Whereas through her weekly blog posts, tweets, and Facebook

                                     updates, Sanchez has provided an unfiltered glimpse into
                                     the realities of day-to-day life in Cuba;
                                                                            ´
                                  Whereas the Castro regime has branded Sanchez as a dis-
                                     sident and, since March 2008, blocked access to her blog
                                     from within Cuba, where mobile phones, flash drives, and
                                     used laptop computers have become lifelines of commu-
                                     nication given economic and government barriers to the
                                     Internet;

                                  Whereas Sanchez refused to be silenced and continued to
                                     write with the help of friends and volunteer collaborators
                                     abroad, who post her entries in solidarity and have trans-

                                  Whereas in 2009, she became the first blogger to ever inter-

                                     fairs to honor her with awards, but was repeatedly denied
