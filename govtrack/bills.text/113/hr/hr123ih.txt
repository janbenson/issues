                                                              RESOLUTION
                                        Expressing support for designation of May as National
                                                      Stroke Awareness Month.

                                  Whereas stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, is
                                     an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood
                                     supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in
                                     the artery or a burst of the artery;
                                  Whereas stroke is a medical emergency that can cause per-
                                     manent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly
                                     diagnosed and treated;
                                  Whereas in the United States, stroke is the fourth leading
                                     cause of death;
                                  Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and





                                     Prevention, 1 person in the United States dies from
                                     stroke every 4 minutes;



                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas every year, more than 795,000 people in the United
                                     States have a stroke;
                                  Whereas stroke costs the United States an estimated
                                     $54,000,000,000 each year, including the costs of health
                                     care services, medications, and missed days of work;
                                  Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term dis-
                                     ability;
                                  Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical ther-
                                     apy and surgeries;
                                  Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments re-
                                     sulting from stroke have a considerable impact on chil-
                                     dren, families, and society; and
                                  Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as
                                     National Stroke Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
                                    2                        (1) supports the designation of National Stroke
                                    3              Awareness Month;

                                    5              to support the efforts, programs, services, and advo-
                                    6              cacy of organizations that work to enhance public
                                    7              awareness of stroke; and
                                    8                        (3) encourages continued coordination and co-
                                    9              operation between government, researchers, families,
                                  10               and the public to improve treatments and prognoses
                                  11               for individuals who suffer strokes.
