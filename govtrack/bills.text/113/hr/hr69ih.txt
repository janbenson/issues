                                                 Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.

                                  Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of can-
                                     cer death among men and women in the United States,
                                     killing more non-smokers than any other cancer;
                                  Whereas every year it is estimated that more than 135,000
                                     individuals in the United States are diagnosed with
                                     colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 individuals die
                                     from the disease;
                                  Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly prevent-
                                     able forms of cancer because screening tests can find pol-
                                     yps that can be removed before becoming cancerous;
                                  Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early,
                                     when treatment works best;
                                  Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
                                     mates that if every individual aged 50 or older had reg-
                                     ular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths
                                     from colorectal cancer could be prevented;
                                  Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized
                                     colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all
                                     diagnoses occur at this stage;
                                  Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce
                                     colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, yet, 1 in 3
                                     adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date
                                     with recommended colorectal cancer screening;
                                  Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on
                                     colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms
                                     are held during the month of March each year; and
                                  Whereas educational efforts can help provide information to
                                     the public of methods of prevention and screening, as
