                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any comprehensive
                                      plan to reform our national energy policy must promote the expanded
                                      use of renewable and alternative energy sources; increase our domestic
                                      refining capacity; promote conservation and increased energy efficiency;
                                      expand research and development, including domestic exploration; and
                                      enhance consumer education.

                                                                 FEBRUARY 6, 2013

                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     any comprehensive plan to reform our national energy
                                     policy must promote the expanded use of renewable and
                                     alternative energy sources; increase our domestic refining
                                     capacity; promote conservation and increased energy effi-
                                     ciency; expand research and development, including do-
                                     mestic exploration; and enhance consumer education.

                                  Whereas the United States consumes roughly an average of





                                     18,949,000 barrels of oil per day;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas the global average of daily oil consumption stands
                                     at 87,421,000 barrels of oil per day;
                                  Whereas the United States total annual energy consumption
                                     is approximately 94.547 quadrillion BTU, with the global
                                     total annual energy consumption at 482.872 quadrillion
                                     BTU;
                                  Whereas the United States share of world energy consump-
                                     tion is projected to fall from 19.5 percent in 2009 to 14.8
                                     percent in 2035;
                                  Whereas according to the International Energy Agency,
                                     China surpassed the United States in energy consump-
                                     tion in 2009 and the Energy Information Administration
                                     projects China’s energy consumption to exceed that of the
                                     United States between the years 2015 and 2020;
                                  Whereas the United States has an estimated 235-year coal
                                     reserve, coal is the most abundant and efficient domestic
                                     fuel source, and processes such as gasification and lique-
                                     faction offer cleaner alternatives for utilizing this re-
                                     source;
                                  Whereas renewable sources of energy account for 8.090 quad-
                                     rillion BTU per year in the United States; and
                                  Whereas such sources such as biomass, geothermal, hydro-
                                     power, nuclear, solar, and wind need and deserve our at-
                                     tention and the necessary resources to encourage their
                                     commercial viability: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
