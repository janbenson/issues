                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     the Congress should not pass any legislation that would
                                     tax or confiscate personal savings accounts, including
                                     retirement accounts such as Individual Retirement Ac-
                                     counts (IRAs) and 401k plans, certificates of deposit
                                     (CDs), or other personal savings to provide financial
                                     relief for private businesses.

                                  Whereas the personal savings and retirement accounts of the
                                     American public are the personal property of their own-





                                     ers;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas personal savings and retirement accounts are used
                                     by millions of Americans to fund their retirement, their
                                     children’s education, their purchase of a family home,
                                     and other uses according to their pursuit of happiness;
                                  Whereas the United States Government should not abuse its
                                     power by substituting political priorities for the personal
                                     economic choices of millions of individual Americans;
                                  Whereas previous attempts to use taxpayer money to provide
                                     financial relief to troubled industries has failed to
                                     produce economic recovery and has undermined the
                                     American system of economic freedom; and
                                  Whereas the American system of economic freedom has given
                                     millions of ordinary people the opportunity to pursue eco-
                                     nomic success and their American dream: Now, therefore,
                                    1be it         Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
                                    2 resentatives that the Congress should—
