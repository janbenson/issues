                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that
                                     the United States should work with the Government
                                     of Haiti to address gender-based violence against women
                                     and children.

                                  Whereas tens of thousands of women and girls have been vic-
                                     tims of sexual or gender-based violence in Haiti, particu-
                                     larly in times of conflict or natural disaster;
                                  Whereas women’s rights groups in Haiti have witnessed dra-
                                     matic increases in rates of sexual violence in many of the





                                     displacement camps established after the earthquake;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas approximately 50 percent of the victims are adoles-
                                     cent girls under the age of 18, with many of the cases
                                     involving the use of weapons, gang rape, and death
                                     threats for reporting the crime;
                                  Whereas medical providers have reported as many as 20 per-
                                     cent of adolescent victims of sexual violence becoming
                                     pregnant as a result of rape;
                                  Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical re-
                                     sources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical exper-
                                     tise, have impeded the arrest and prosecution of suspects;
                                  Whereas members of many medical professions are insuffi-
                                     ciently trained to attend to the special needs of victims
                                     of gender-based violence, whether they be children or
                                     adults;
                                  Whereas according to data from public interest law firms in-
                                     volved in prosecuting cases of sexual violence, significant
                                     gender-based barriers to justice continue to exist at all
                                     levels of the Haitian justice system;
                                  Whereas members of the police, prosecutors, and judges are
                                     insufficiently trained to attend to either the special needs
                                     of victims of gender-based violence, or the special needs
                                     of those individuals who are victims of other abuses such
                                     as forced labor, beatings, or violence;
                                  Whereas the special police unit to address gender-based vio-
                                     lence within the Haitian National Police remains signifi-
                                     cantly under-resourced, rendering it practically ineffective
                                     to carry out its mandate;
                                  Whereas few mechanisms exist in Haiti to protect the rights





                                     of young children not living at home, such as restaveks,
                                     who are engaged in forced labor and especially vulnerable
                                     to sexual violence;

                                  Whereas the lack of physical protection discourages women
                                     and girls in Haiti from pursuing prosecution of perpetra-
                                     tors of sexual violence, for fear of reprisal or stigmatiza-

                                  Whereas rape and other forms of gender-based violence in
                                     Haiti threaten the physical and psychological health of
                                     both the victims and their families;
                                  Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial sys-
                                     tem is key to the administration of justice, and the fail-

                                     dermines the ability to hold perpetrators accountable for
                                     their crimes and discourages victims from formally seek-
                                     ing justice;
                                  Whereas the Government of Haiti has undertaken efforts to
                                     prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its rati-
                                     fication of the United Nations Convention on the Elimi-
                                     nation of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,

                                     to promote and protect the rights of women;
                                  Whereas the Ministry for the Status of Women and Women’s
                                     Rights in Haiti has been working on a comprehensive law
                                     that calls for the prevention, punishment, and elimination
                                     of violence against women;
                                  Whereas the Government of Haiti has been a signatory of the

                                  Whereas in March 2009, the Inter-American Commission on
                                     Human Rights issued a report recognizing Haiti’s history
                                     of gender discrimination that fuels gender-based violence
                                     and gives rise to a climate of impunity; and
