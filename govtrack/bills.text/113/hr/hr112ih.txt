                                  Celebrating the history of municipal bonds, the 100-year precedent of the
                                       Federal tax exemption for municipal bond interest, and the important
                                       contribution municipal bonds have made to economic growth and
                                       wellbeing in each State and municipality in our great Nation.




                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                                MARCH 13, 2013
                                     Mr. TERRY (for himself and Mr. NEAL) submitted the following resolution;
                                            which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Celebrating the history of municipal bonds, the 100-year
                                      precedent of the Federal tax exemption for municipal
                                      bond interest, and the important contribution municipal
                                      bonds have made to economic growth and wellbeing in
                                      each State and municipality in our great Nation.

                                  Whereas in the 200 years since the first recorded municipal
                                     bond was issued by the City of New York to build a
                                     canal, municipal bonds have helped build a strong econ-
                                     omy and provide for the health and welfare of our citi-
                                     zenry;
                                  Whereas three-quarters of all infrastructure investments





                                     made in the United States are financed by municipal
                                     bonds;



                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas municipal bonds finance infrastructure projects that
                                     touch the daily lives of every American citizen and busi-
                                     ness—roads we drive on, schools and education for our
                                     children, affordable family housing, water systems that
                                     supply safe drinking water, courthouses, hospitals and
                                     clinics to treat the sick, airports and ports that help
                                     move products domestically and overseas, and utility
                                     plants that power our homes, businesses, and factories;
                                  Whereas interest on municipal bonds is exempt from Federal
                                     taxation as part of the principle of reciprocal immunity
                                     under which the Federal Government is exempt from
                                     State and local taxation and State and local governments
                                     are exempt from Federal taxation;
                                  Whereas the Federal Revenue Act of 1913 codified this prin-
                                     ciple as part of the Federal income tax by exempting
                                     from income tax the interest on municipal bonds;
                                  Whereas exempting municipal bond interest from Federal
                                     taxation reduces the cost of infrastructure financing by
                                     State and local governments;
                                  Whereas reduced infrastructure costs for State and local gov-
                                     ernments allow for greater infrastructure investments
                                     and savings passed directly to taxpayers and ratepayers
                                     in the form of reduced taxes and fees;
                                  Whereas, because of critical infrastructure needs, it is esti-
                                     mated that in 2013, $300 billion of municipal bonds will
                                     be issued;
                                  Whereas keeping infrastructure costs low is critical for job
                                     creation and rebuilding infrastructure is crucial to our





                                     Nation’s State and local economies, including power gen-
                                     eration, distribution, and transmission;

                                  Whereas the ability of municipal bonds and the 100-year
                                     precedent of the Federal income tax exemption for mu-
                                     nicipal bonds provides State and local governments timely
                                     access to cost-effective capital; and
                                  Whereas the Federal tax exemption for municipal bond inter-
                                     est is a cost-effective financing vehicle available to State
                                     and local governments: Now, therefore, be it
