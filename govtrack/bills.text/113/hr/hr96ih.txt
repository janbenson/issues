                                       Expressing support for designation of the week of March
                                         3 through 9, 2013, as ‘‘School Social Work Week’’.

                                  Whereas the importance of school social work through the in-
                                     clusion of school social work programs has been recog-
                                     nized in the current authorizations of the Elementary
                                     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301
                                     et seq.) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education
                                     Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);
                                  Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a
                                     school’s educational team, playing a central role in cre-
                                     ating a positive school climate and vital partnerships be-
                                     tween the home, school, and community to ensure stu-

                                  Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in pro-
                                     viding services to students who face serious challenges to


                                                                                             2
                                          school success, including poverty, disability, discrimina-
                                          tion, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of parents, loss of
                                          a loved one, and other barriers to learning;
                                  Whereas there is a growing need for local educational agen-
                                     cies to offer the mental health services that school social
                                     workers provide when working with families, teachers,
                                     principals, community agencies, and other entities to ad-
                                     dress students’ emotional, physical, and environmental
                                     needs so that students may achieve behavioral and aca-
                                     demic success;
                                  Whereas to achieve the goal of helping all children reach their
                                     optimal levels of potential and achievement schools must
                                     work to remove the emotional, behavioral, and academic
                                     barriers that interfere with student success in school;
                                  Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 of the children in need of mental
                                     health services actually receive these services, and re-
                                     search indicates that school mental health programs im-
                                     prove educational outcomes by decreasing absences, de-
                                     creasing discipline referrals, and improving academic
                                     achievement;
                                  Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early
                                     identification of mental health problems and in the provi-
                                     sion of appropriate services when needed; and
                                  Whereas the celebration of School Social Work Week during
                                     the week of March 3 through 9, 2013, highlights the vital
                                     role school social workers play in the lives of students in
                                     the United States: Now, therefore, be it
