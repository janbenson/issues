                                          Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives
                                            regarding women’s health and economic security.

                                  Whereas improving the health and well-being of women is a
                                     stated goal of Healthy People 2020, the comprehensive,

                                     and Human Services;
                                  Whereas older women and women with disabilities rely on
                                     Medicare and low-income women rely on Medicaid for af-
                                     fordable, quality health care;





                                  Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is
                                     critical to improving the health and well-being of women;


                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas uninsured women are 3 times less likely to have had
                                     a Pap test in the last 3 years, with a 60 percent greater
                                     risk of late-stage cervical cancer diagnosis;
                                  Whereas 50 percent of uninsured women do not have a reg-
                                     ular doctor compared to 11 percent of insured women;
                                  Whereas significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in
                                     women’s health, particularly in maternal mortality, infant
                                     mortality, and incidence of premature or low birth weight
                                     births;
                                  Whereas lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
                                     women have unique health care needs and confront a
                                     unique set of disparities in the current health care sys-

                                  Whereas pregnant women are often excluded from research
                                     studies violating the ethical principle of justice;
                                  Whereas federally funded research is a critical component to
                                     understanding health conditions in women across the life
                                     span, and has led to many scientific breakthroughs that
                                     have been become clinical standards of care;
                                  Whereas about half of pregnancies are unintended, though
                                     preventing unintended pregnancies benefits child health,
                                     maternal health, and the health and well-being of families
                                     and society as a whole;
                                  Whereas there are continued efforts to defund or eliminate
                                     family planning programs, even though they are proven
                                     to reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce the need
                                     for abortions;
                                  Whereas the Medicaid program covers 71 percent of publicly





                                     funded family planning services and over 40 percent of
                                     all United States births and the Title X Family Planning

                                          for Medicaid;
                                  Whereas there have been numerous attempts, both legal and
                                     legislative, to allow insurance companies and employers
                                     with personal religious or moral objections to deny
                                     women the Affordable Care Act preventive services ben-

                                     tive methods, despite the fact that such services are
                                     based on a foundation of scientific, medical evidence sup-
                                     porting the effectiveness of preventive services;
                                  Whereas over-the-counter emergency contraception is not
                                     available to all women, even though the American College
                                     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American
                                     Academy of Pediatrics recommend increased access to
                                     emergency contraception, without an age restriction, as a
                                     back-up birth control option, as research shows it pre-
                                     vents unintended pregnancies and reduces the need for
                                     abortion;
                                  Whereas a lack of adequate prenatal care increases the risks
                                     of having low birth-weight or preterm babies, neonatal
                                     mortality, infant mortality, and maternal mortality;
                                  Whereas preterm births alone costs the United States health
                                     care system $26,000,000,000 annually;
                                  Whereas many women lack access to comprehensive, afford-
                                     able insurance coverage, even though all women should
                                     have this for all pregnancy-related care, including pre-
                                     natal care, miscarriage management, family planning
                                     services, abortion, labor and delivery services, and post-

                                  Whereas in 2012, State legislatures passed 43 laws in 19
                                     States to restrict access to abortion, the second-highest
                                     number of such measures passed in a single year;
                                  Whereas efforts have been made to ban Graduate Medical
                                     Education funding from going towards abortion training,
                                     even though the Accreditation Council for Graduate Med-
                                     ical Education (ACGME) standards stipulate that pro-

                                     jeopardize patient safety;

                                  Whereas intimate partner violence affects 1,500,000 women
                                     each year and 324,000 pregnant women each year; the

                                     death, and the indirect effects can include delayed pre-
