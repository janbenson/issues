                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                            FEBRUARY 12, 2013
                                    Mr. ANDREWS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the
                                              Committee on Oversight and Government Reform




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing support for designation of the first Saturday
                                     in October as ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s
                                     Day’’ to create awareness, educate humans of the impor-
                                     tance of adoption, and create a humane environment
                                     for any pet, including the importance of spaying and
                                     neutering of animals, and the encouragement of animal
                                     adoptions throughout the United States.

                                  Whereas between 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 cats and dogs are
                                     placed into shelters every year and between 3,000,000
                                     and 4,000,000 are euthanized;





                                  Whereas the United States has suffered a drastic economic
                                     crisis that has left animals behind in abandoned homes



                                                                                             2
                                          to die or left on the doorsteps of overpopulated shelters
                                          and rescues;
                                  Whereas a greater awareness of dog fighting and abuse en-
                                     courages these animals to be put to sleep or left for shel-
                                     ters or rescues to rehabilitate them;
                                  Whereas there are between 4,000 to 6,000 animal shelters
                                     throughout the United States in need of pet supplies,
                                     medical supplies, blankets and towels, cleaning supplies,
                                     food, and educational materials about owning a pet, as
                                     well as information on how to screen unqualified appli-
                                     cants and provide the best pet match for a family;
                                  Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue
                                     programs throughout the United States will significantly
                                     reduce the number of cats and dogs euthanized and re-
                                     duce the number of animals returned to a shelter who
                                     have been rescued;
                                  Whereas a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day’’
                                     will reduce the problem of pet overpopulation, provide
                                     animals with good homes, and create awareness as well
                                     as financial and educational resources for the problems
                                     animal shelters face each day;
                                  Whereas a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day’’
                                     would encourage homes for harmless animals like Wins-
                                     low, a Basset Hound who spent his first 8 months of life
                                     starved and confined in a cage so small that his rear legs
                                     were unable to fully develop and then was placed in mul-
                                     tiple shelters before being adopted into a loving home;
                                     and





                                  Whereas the first Saturday in October would be an appro-
                                     priate day to designate as ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day/
                                     Winslow’s Day’’ and celebrate it through events, festivals,

                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports
                                    2 the designation of a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day/Wins-
