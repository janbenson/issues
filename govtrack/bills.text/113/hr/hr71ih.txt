                                     Olympic Games;
                                  Whereas wrestling is one of the world’s most diverse sports,
                                     with participants from almost 200 countries around the
                                     world;

                                     grams in the United States;
                                  Whereas wrestling represents the determination and hard
                                     work it takes to succeed in life and sport;
                                  Whereas the United States has a long, proud, and storied
                                     Olympic wrestling history; and
                                  Whereas wrestling epitomizes the spirit of the Olympic
                                     Games: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
