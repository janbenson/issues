                                                             MARCH 18, 2013

                                                              RESOLUTION
                                     Supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Health
                                                              Week.

                                  Whereas the week of April 1, 2013, through April 7, 2013,
                                     is National Public Health Week, and the theme for 2013
                                     is ‘‘Public Health is ROI: Save Lives, Save Money’’;
                                  Whereas, since 1995, public health organizations have used
                                     National Public Health Week to educate the public, pol-
                                     icymakers, and public health professionals about issues
                                     that are important to improving the health of the people
                                     of the United States;
                                  Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in the
                                     air people breathe, the water they drink, the food they
                                     eat, and the places where they live, learn, work, and play;





                                  Whereas each 10 percent increase in local public health
                                     spending contributes to a 6.9 percent decrease in infant


                                                                                             2
                                          deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in cardiovascular deaths,
                                          a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, and a
                                          1.1 percent decrease in deaths due to cancer;
                                  Whereas routine childhood immunizations save $9,900,000 in
                                     direct health care costs, save 33,000 lives, and prevent
                                     14,000,000 cases of disease;
                                  Whereas childhood health problems linked to preventable en-
                                     vironmental exposures, such as lead poisoning, asthma
                                     complications, and developmental disabilities, cost the
                                     United States $76,600,000,000 in 2008, and those costs
                                     increased from 2.8 percent of total health care costs in
                                     1997 to 3.5 percent in 2008;
                                  Whereas the cost of providing dental care for Medicaid-eligi-
                                     ble children who live in communities without water fluori-
                                     dation is twice as high as the cost for providing dental
                                     care for Medicaid-eligible children who receive the oral
                                     health benefits of drinking water with fluoridation;
                                  Whereas a $52 investment in a child safety seat prevents
                                     $2,200 in medical costs, resulting in a return of $42 for
                                     every $1 invested;
                                  Whereas an investment in workplace wellness initiatives re-
                                     duces sick leave and results in a return of $3.27 in med-
                                     ical costs alone for every $1 invested;
                                  Whereas health problems linked to hunger and food insecu-
                                     rity cost $130,500,000,000 annually;
                                  Whereas, from 1991 to 2006, investments in HIV prevention
                                     averted more than 350,000 infections and saved more
                                     than $125,000,000,000 in medical costs; and
                                  Whereas, by adequately supporting public health and preven-





                                     tion, the people of the United States can transform a
                                     health system focused on treating illness into a health
