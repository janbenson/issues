                                   Recognizing the importance of acknowledging the contributions of Dominican-

                                                             FEBRUARY 26, 2013
                                  Mr. RANGEL (for himself, Mr. SERRANO, Mr. PIERLUISI, Mr. MORAN, Mr.
                                      CROWLEY, and Mr. CICILLINE) submitted the following resolution; which
                                      was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                         Recognizing the importance of acknowledging the
                                    contributions of Dominican-Americans to the United States.

                                  Whereas since the initial wave of Dominican migration in the
                                     1960s to the most recent arrivals of today, Dominicans
                                     have worked hard to contribute to the national identity
                                     of the United States, educating people on their culture
                                     and traditions and enriching the quality of our shared fu-
                                     tures;
                                  Whereas Dominican-Americans living on our shores have
                                     been motivated by the value of hard work and the bonds
                                     of family, the same pillars of our society that has built
                                     this great Nation for over 230 years;





                                  Whereas contributions from Dominican-Americans can be
                                     found in every facet of United States life, from the many


                                                                                             2

                                          Oscar de la Renta, to the thousands of professionals that
                                          do battle as soldiers, doctors, lawyers, journalists, edu-
                                          cators, and many other public servants;
                                  Whereas many of our hemisphere’s first institutions were es-
                                     tablished on the shores of the Dominican Republic, in-
                                     cluding the first cathedral and the oldest university;
                                  Whereas Dominicans are freedom loving people who first
                                     began their campaign for their independence in 1831
                                     under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte, who formed
                                     a secret society named The Trinity that led to a decisive
                                     uprising, which resulted in independence for the Domini-
                                     can Republic;
                                  Whereas after the long and hard fought campaign for free-

                                     1844, marked the Dominican Republic’s first official
                                     Independence Day;
                                  Whereas it is appropriate that the United States reserve the
                                     period between January 21 to February 27 to celebrate
                                     and honor Dominican heritage;
                                  Whereas it would be befitting to celebrate Dominican heritage
                                     beginning on January 21, The Day of the Procession of
                                     Altagracia, The Dominican Republic’s most important re-
                                     ligious celebration;
                                  Whereas it would also be befitting to end the period of Do-
                                     minican heritage on February 27, the Dominican Repub-
                                     lic’s Independence Day;
                                  Whereas during the period between January 21 to February




                                     27 of each year, the Dominican people also celebrate Car-
                                     nival, the biggest, most colorful event in the Dominican
                                     Republic where participants dress in colorful masks and

                                  Whereas it would give us the opportunity to acknowledge and
                                     applaud the economic, cultural, and social contributions
                                     Dominican-Americans have made to the United States;
                                     and
                                  Whereas it would also give us an opportunity to consider the
                                     many Dominican achievements, on the island and in the
                                     United States: Now, therefore, be it
                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
                                    2                        (1) recognizes the importance of acknowledging
                                    3              the contributions of Dominican-Americans to the

                                    5                        (2) supports the establishment of a national
