                                     2013 as ‘‘National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and
                                     Prevention Month’’.

                                  Whereas while dating violence, domestic violence, sexual vio-
                                     lence, and stalking affect women regardless of age, teens
                                     and young women are especially vulnerable;
                                  Whereas according to a National Intimate Partner and Sex-
                                     ual Violence survey by the Centers for Disease Control
                                     and Prevention (CDC), the majority of victimization

                                  Whereas in 2008, the National Council on Crime and Delin-
                                     quency reported that approximately 1 in 3 adolescent





                                     girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emo-
                                     tional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that


                                                                                             2
                                          far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence
                                          affecting youth;
                                  Whereas according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
                                     System (YRBSS) of the CDC, nearly 10 percent of high
                                     school students have been hit, slapped, or physically hurt
                                     on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend in the past year;
                                  Whereas a 2012 study as part of an independent evaluation

                                     middle school youth, finds teen dating violence behaviors
                                     common even among 7th-grade students with nearly one
                                     in six reporting physical dating violence;
                                  Whereas according to data from the YRBSS, almost 20 per-
                                     cent of teen girls who were exposed to physical dating vi-
                                     olence did not attend school on 1 or more occasions dur-
                                     ing the past 30 days due to feeling unsafe at school or
                                     on the way to or from school;
                                  Whereas schools are unequipped to handle the issue, as a re-
                                     cent study by Ball State University found that 81 per-
                                     cent of school counselors reported that they did not have
                                     a school protocol on how to respond to an incident of
                                     teen dating violence but 61 percent reported that they
                                     had assisted victims of dating-related violence in the past
                                     2 years, despite a lack of formal training for some of the
                                     counselors;
                                  Whereas a study published in Pediatrics suggests that teen
                                     dating violence ‘‘is a substantial public health problem’’
                                     as victims of teen dating violence are at increased risk of
                                     mood and behavior problems as young adults, and at in-

                                  Whereas girls victimized by a teen boyfriend reported more

                                     cide, and teens of both sexes who were in aggressive rela-
                                     tionships were 2 to 3 times more likely to be in violent
                                     relationships as young adults;
                                  Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen
                                     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and
                                     more than twice as likely to contract a sexually trans-

                                  Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as
                                     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know
                                     little or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;
                                  Whereas according to the 2009 Parent/Teen Dating Violence
                                     Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., although 82 percent of par-
                                     ents are confident that they could recognize the signs if
                                     their child was experiencing dating abuse, 58 percent of

                                     signs of abuse;
                                  Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of teen-
                                     age girls say that they have not had a conversation with

                                  Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say that they have

                                  Whereas according to the 2010 College Dating Violence and

                                  Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners has
                                     been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of
