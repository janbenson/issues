                                                IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                                               FEBRUARY 5, 2013
                                  Ms. WILSON of Florida (for herself, Mr. CLEAVER, Mrs. CHRISTENSEN, Ms.

                                      lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary




                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Honoring the life of Trayvon Martin, urging the repeal of
                                     Stand Your Ground laws, and calling on the United
                                     States Government to address the crisis of racial
                                     profiling.

                                  Whereas Trayvon Martin would have celebrated his 18th
                                     birthday on February 5, 2013;
                                  Whereas on February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, an African-
                                     American youth, was horrifically shot and killed while
                                     walking from his local 7-Eleven in Sanford, Florida, be-
                                     cause he was viewed as ‘‘suspicious’’ by George Zimmer-





                                     man;




                                                                                             2
                                  Whereas Zimmerman, a self-appointed, untrained neighbor-
                                     hood watch volunteer, admitted to police that he shot
                                     Martin in the chest;
                                  Whereas Trayvon Martin was racially profiled, stalked,
                                     chased, made to fight for his life, and ultimately mur-
                                     dered;
                                  Whereas Zimmerman raised a ‘‘self-defense’’ claim and Mar-
                                     tin, as the deceased victim, was unable to rebut such
                                     claim;
                                  Whereas a police officer is held accountable for every bullet
                                     he or she discharges, and a private citizen should be held
                                     to the same standard with regard to the use of deadly
                                     physical force;
                                  Whereas Trayvon Martin’s brutal death and the inconceivable
                                     fact that his killer remains free should not be ignored;
                                  Whereas over 2,200,000 signatures have been collected on an
                                     online petition demanding justice for Martin’s family;
                                  Whereas Zimmerman’s unfounded assumptions and racial
                                     bias led to the use of deadly force;
                                  Whereas Travyon Martin was a victim of the prejudice and
                                     societal isolation of Black boys and men;
                                  Whereas this case sets a horrific precedent of vigilante justice
                                     and compromises the integrity of the legal system;
                                  Whereas Florida’s Stand Your Ground law has been criticized
                                     by both the legal and law enforcement communities;
                                  Whereas John F. Timoney, the former Miami police chief,
                                     Philadelphia police commissioner and deputy police com-





                                     missioner in New York, has declared Stand Your Ground
                                     laws to be a ‘‘recipe for disaster,’’ which ‘‘give citizens
                                     unfettered power and discretion with no accountability’’;

                                                                                             3
                                  Whereas over 20 States have passed and implemented Stand
                                     Your Ground laws;
                                  Whereas Stand Your Ground laws dramatically and recklessly
                                     expand the right of citizens to use deadly force, and have
                                     been the subject of national scrutiny in the wake of
                                     Trayvon Martin’s death; and
                                  Whereas Stand Your Ground laws were drafted by organiza-
                                     tions, corporations, and individuals that ignored advice
                                     from experts explaining that such laws would compromise
                                     public safety, disproportionately impact communities of
                                     color, and would result in offenders circumventing pros-

                                    1              Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
                                    2                        (1) condemns unfounded reliance on Stand
                                    3              Your Ground laws to protect actions that extend far
                                    4              beyond historical use of self-defense;
                                    5                        (2) urges any State legislature to reject or re-

                                    7                        (3) commits to developing incentives for States
                                    8              to find alternatives to Stand Your Ground legislation
                                    9              such as grants for community policing;

                                  11               dividuals found to have caused substantive harm
