<p>Mr. GRAVES of Missouri (for himself and Mr. CONNOLLY) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</p><hr/><p/><center><p>RESOLUTION</p></center>
<p>Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to ensure the continuation of its 6-day mail delivery service.</p><p>Whereas the United States Postal Service has announced that it may need to reduce the frequency of its mail delivery service from 6 days a week to 5 days a week;</p><p>Whereas 6-day mail delivery service is an essential service that the American people have relied on since 1912, particularly working families that depend on the Postal Service for the timely delivery of their paychecks;</p><p>Whereas Social Security is the primary or sole source of income for many senior citizens, and any delay in the delivery of their Social Security checks would make it difficult for them to purchase even essential items, such as food and medicine; and</p><p>Whereas reducing mail delivery service to 5 days a week would inevitably cause not only delays in the delivery of mail, but higher postal costs, due to the many hours of additional overtime that the Postal Service would require in order to handle the resulting back-up of mail: Now, therefore, be it</p><ul><p><em>  Resolved,</em> That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to ensure the continuation of its 6-day mail delivery service.</p></ul></body>
