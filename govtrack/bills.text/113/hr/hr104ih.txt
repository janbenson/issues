                                                                 MARCH 6, 2013
                                  Ms. BROWNLEY of California (for herself and Mr. COOK) submitted the fol-
                                      lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Serv-
                                      ices, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, for a period
                                      to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consider-
                                      ation of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee

                                                              RESOLUTION
                                  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
                                     ing the importance of easing the transition of members
                                     of the Armed Forces and their families from military
                                     to civilian life.

                                  Whereas members of the Armed Forces and their families
                                     make great sacrifices on behalf of the United States, and,
                                     when their active duty service is successfully concluded,
                                     members deserve the opportunity to also make a success-
                                     ful transition to the civilian labor force;
                                  Whereas, when transitioning from active duty in the Armed





                                     Forces to civilian employment, members often face bar-



                                                                                             2
                                          riers that make it difficult to fully utilize the skills and
                                          training they gained during their military service;
                                  Whereas members and veterans are too often required to re-
                                     peat education or training in order to receive industry
                                     certifications and State occupational licenses, even
                                     though their military training and experience often over-
                                     laps with the certification or licensing requirements;
                                  Whereas, when members are transferred from military as-
                                     signment to military assignment, their spouses often face
                                     barriers to transferring their credentials and to securing
                                     employment in their new location;
                                  Whereas more than one million members will make the tran-
                                     sition to civilian life in the coming years;
                                  Whereas the Department of Defense established the Military
                                     Credentialing and Licensing Task Force in 2012; and
                                  Whereas the Joining Forces program, a national initiative to
                                     mobilize all sectors of society to give members of the
                                     Armed Forces and their families the opportunities and
                                     support they have earned, will make it easier for mem-
                                     bers and their families to transfer skills learned while the
                                     member was serving in the Armed Forces to civilian em-
                                     ployment: Now, therefore, be it
