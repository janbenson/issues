  <ul>
    <p nid="t0:rfs:15" tracking-nids="t0:ih:16">(a) Purpose- The purpose of this Act is to require the President to submit to Congress a supplemental unified budget if the President&#x2019;s budget for fiscal year 2014 does not achieve balance in a fiscal year covered by such budget.</p>
    <p nid="t0:rfs:16" tracking-nids="t0:ih:17">(b) Findings- Congress finds the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:17" tracking-nids="t0:ih:18">(1) With this year&#x2019;s expected failure to meet the statutory deadline for submission of his budget, as stated by the Office of Management and Budget, the President will have only met the statutory deadline in one of his five budget submissions.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:18" tracking-nids="t0:ih:19">(2) Despite a promise to cut the deficit in half, the deficit doubled during the President&#x2019;s first year in office and has exceeded $1 trillion for four years now.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:19" tracking-nids="t0:ih:20">(3) Since taking office, the President has allowed the Federal debt to grow by nearly $6 trillion and total debt now exceeds the size of the entire economy of the United States.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:20" tracking-nids="t0:ih:21">(4) Under the President&#x2019;s most recent budget submission, the budget never achieves balance.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:21" tracking-nids="t0:ih:22">(5) The President&#x2019;s fiscal year 2013 budget submission includes the admission that under his own policies the Federal Government&#x2019;s &#x2018;fiscal position gradually deteriorates&#x2019;.</p>
    </ul>
  </ul>
