  <ul>
    <p nid="t0:rfs:18" tracking-nids="t0:ih:16">Congress finds the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:19" tracking-nids="t0:ih:17">(1) Hurricane Sandy inflicted catastrophic damage in the Northeastern United States.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:20" tracking-nids="t0:ih:18">(2) Houses of worship across the Northeast&#x2019;s many faiths and denominations were among the private nonprofit facilities that sustained damage.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:21" tracking-nids="t0:ih:19">(3) Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other houses of worship throughout communities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and elsewhere play an essential role in the daily lives of the communities.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:22" tracking-nids="t0:ih:20">(4) The Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x2019;s (FEMA) public assistance program provides financial grants for the repair of various types of private nonprofit facilities.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:23" tracking-nids="t0:ih:21">(5) Among the types of nonprofits to which FEMA provides such grants are those in which citizens gather and engage in a variety of educational, enrichment, and social activities. These activities are essential to community building and occur in houses of worship.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:24">(6) Under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (<usc-reference title="42" section="5121" paragraph=""><usc-reference title="42" section="5121" paragraph="">42 U.S.C. 5121</usc-reference></usc-reference> et seq.), FEMA&#x2019;s disaster relief program is a general government program under which assistance is provided in the wake of a natural disaster using criteria that are neutral with regard to religion.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:25" tracking-nids="t0:ih:23">(7) Congress has previously enacted legislation providing financial assistance to religious nonprofit institutions, including houses of worship, on terms equal to other eligible nonprofit institutions.</p>
      <p nid="t0:rfs:26" tracking-nids="t0:ih:24">(8) Such legislation is consistent with recent precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States and legal opinions issued by the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice.</p>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3 nid="t0:rfs:27" tracking-nids="t0:ih:25">SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP AS PRIVATE NONPROFIT FACILITIES ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER RELIEF.</h3>
