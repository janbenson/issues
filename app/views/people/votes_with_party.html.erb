  <h2>Voting With Party</h2>
</div>

<div class="padding">
  <p class='behave'>This is a ranking of how often <%= @party_adj %> <%= @people_names %> vote with a majority of the <%= @chamber.capitalize %> <%= @party_adj %> caucus. It factors every single vote that has been taken since the beginning of the current <%= Settings.default_congress.ordinalize %> session of Congress. All votes are weighted equally in this ranking, so a non-binding resolution honoring a collegiate sports team, for example, is considered equal to a vote on passing health care reform. Since the vast majority of the hundreds of votes factored in are routine in nature, the result is that even highly-independent senators have a seemingly high score on voting with their party. But it's the context that matters, and this ranking attempts to provide that. Obviously, this gives only a partial picture of the ideological spectrum. If you want to see how senators have voted on major legislation in Congress, check out our section of <a href="/roll_call/all?sort=hotbills">Hot Bills</a> or use our <a href='/person/compare'>head-to-head vote comparison tool</a> to compare the voting records of any two members of Congress.  The average <%= @party %> -- <%= link_to_person(@median) %> -- votes with <%= @median.gender == 'M' ? "his" : "her" %> party <%= number_with_precision(@median.votes_with_party_percentage, :precision => 1) %>% of the time.</p>
