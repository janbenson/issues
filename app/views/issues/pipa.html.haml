  %p Today, OpenCongress is proud to join the global online action to protest the PIPA net censorship bill.

  %p Since 2007, the Participatory Politics Foundation has operated OpenCongress as a free, open-source, non-partisan Web resource for watchdogging the U.S. Congress. PIPA poses an existential threat to our public-education mission. By establishing a dangerous legal framework for net censorship in the U.S., it endangers free political speech online and the existence of sites like OpenCongress that aggregate data & links from a variety of sources. 

  / Legislation as preposterously terrible -- even un-Constitutional -- as SOPA and PIPA should have been non-starters. A diverse coalition of opponents -- from tech entrepreneurs to non-profit organizations -- have argued correctly that the bill will negatively affect economic development, the free flow of information, and net neutrality. Clearly, the only reason that the Senate is rushing to hold a vote on PIPA as soon as it returns on January 24th is that they don't want any more public scrutiny or protests of its many fundamental flaws -- and that supporters of the bill have given more than four times as much in campaign contributions as have opponents. PIPA is a perfectly egregious example of systemic corruption in the U.S. Congress and the reasons why our representative democracy badly needs comprehensive electoral reforms, including full public financing of federal elections, to mitigate the corrosive influence of corporate money in the political process.
