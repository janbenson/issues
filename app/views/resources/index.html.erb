    <h3>OpenMass.org</h3>
    <p>OpenMass.org is an independent public resource website created by Jim Caralis. Modeled on OpenCongress, OpenMass uses our open-source website code in presenting data from the website of the Massachusetts state legislature alongside news and blog coverage. We're very excited by OpenMass, which is also in beta, and also a non-profit project, though not affiliated with OpenCongress. We hope to see the OpenCongress model extend to state, local, and other levels, and we'll be working with Jim Caralis to document more of his process in creating OpenMass.</p>
