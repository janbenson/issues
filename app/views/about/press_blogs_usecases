<p>Below is a sample of the ways in which news outlets, bloggers, individuals, and issue-based groups of all backgrounds are using OpenCongress to track and share information about their political interests. We'll work to continually update this list, but it's not meant to be exhaustive -- to be sure, there are lots of great uses of OpenCongress out there on the Web that aren't mentioned below. But this is a start to demonstrate in concrete ways how we can build public knowledge about Congress together.
